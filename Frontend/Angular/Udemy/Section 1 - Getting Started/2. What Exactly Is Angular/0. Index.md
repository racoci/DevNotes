00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:05.690
<v Maximilian>So what is Angular and why would you use it?</v>

2
00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.070
Well, Angular is actually two things.

3
00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.230
First and most importantly,

4
00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.920
it's a front-end Java script framework,

5
00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.920
which means it's collection of packages and rules,

6
00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.290
you could say, that you should follow when using it,

7
00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:28.560
that help you build advanced, feature-rich,

8
00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.880
and highly interactive web user interfaces.

9
00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.210
And Angular simply makes that process

10
00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.840
of building such user interfaces simpler

11
00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.650
and easier than it would be if you would be using

12
00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:47.970
just JavaScript without a framework like Angular.

13
00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:52.860
And I'll get back to how it does that in just a second.

14
00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.030
But Angular is actually not just this framework part,

15
00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.450
even though that's the most important part of Angular,

16
00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:03.810
but it's actually also a collection of tools

17
00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:06.750
that come together with that framework

18
00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.720
and a collection of extra features you can use

19
00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.820
as a web developer.

20
00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.150
For example, a command line interface that helps

21
00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.820
with creating Angular projects

22
00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.890
and spinning up development servers

23
00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.420
to preview those projects, but also extra debugging tools,

24
00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.300
plugins for IDEs and code editors

25
00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:31.530
to enhance the development experience, and so on.

26
00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.310
And with that framework and those extra tools

27
00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.850
and features, you therefore have a platform

28
00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.550
on which you can build up to build anything

29
00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:44.190
from basic trivial, all the way up

30
00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:47.913
to complex enterprise level web applications.
