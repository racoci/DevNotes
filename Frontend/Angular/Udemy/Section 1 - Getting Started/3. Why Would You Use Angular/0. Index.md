00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.632
<v Maximilian>So now that you know what Angular is,</v>

2
00:00:04.632 --> 00:00:06.540
a valid question, of course,

3
00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.660
would be why you would use Angular.

4
00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.340
Why would you use a framework like Angular in general,

5
00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.330
instead of just using just JavaScript?

6
00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.830
And especially for pretty trivial web applications

7
00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.260
and web user interfaces,

8
00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.210
you indeed might not need a solution like Angular.

9
00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.380
But frameworks like Angular do really shine

10
00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.380
as your applications become more complex

11
00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.312
because they simplify the process

12
00:00:40.312 --> 00:00:45.312
of building complex, highly interactive web user interfaces.

13
00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.800
And Angular does simplify this process

14
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.540
by giving you many useful features, and rules,

15
00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:57.420
and concepts you should apply when using it.

16
00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:58.770
But most importantly,

17
00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.770
because of four main things it brings to the table.

18
00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.300
And the first one is that with Angular,

19
00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:10.740
you can write declarative code instead of imperative code

20
00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.830
as you do it with Vanilla JavaScript.

21
00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.640
And this simply means that with Vanilla JavaScript,

22
00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.640
you have to step by step, write every single instruction

23
00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.440
that should be executed by the browser so that you,

24
00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:29.220
for example, want to reach out to some DOM element

25
00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.380
that you then have certain conditions

26
00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:32.730
that should be validated,

27
00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:35.850
and that then depending on which condition is met

28
00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.290
or what happened, you want to change something in the DOM.

29
00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.020
You have to all write it down explicitly

30
00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.250
and give the browser those step by step instructions.

31
00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.490
With frameworks like Angular that changes.

32
00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.040
There you instead write declarative code,

33
00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:58.040
which means you define the target state or states.

34
00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.210
So in the end, some markup

35
00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.820
that contains special instructions

36
00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.100
that are unlocked by Angular,

37
00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.150
so that would not work with just Vanilla JavaScript.

38
00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:11.370
The browser wouldn't understand them,

39
00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.070
but they are unlocked by Angular

40
00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:18.690
and they allow you to define different target states

41
00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.180
and then you can also write some logic

42
00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.222
that makes sure that those states get activated

43
00:02:24.222 --> 00:02:27.510
or deactivated depending on the occurrence

44
00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.730
of certain events and so on.

45
00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.250
But it's then Angular's job

46
00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.670
to figure out which steps must be taken

47
00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.300
to update the visible user interface accordingly,

48
00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:43.890
so that those target states are reflected on the screen.

49
00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.620
That's what declarative code means.

50
00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.580
You don't have to manually reach out to those DOM elements

51
00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.050
or anything like that,

52
00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:55.500
instead you write declarative code in your markup

53
00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.290
and Angular does the heavy lifting.

54
00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:01.290
In addition, Angular also allows you

55
00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.966
to easily separate concerns

56
00:03:03.966 --> 00:03:07.680
by embracing a concept called Components.

57
00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.183
When working with Angular,

58
00:03:10.183 --> 00:03:13.590
you built a lot of so-called Components,

59
00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:17.610
which essentially are custom HTML elements,

60
00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:18.622
you could say,

61
00:03:18.622 --> 00:03:21.180
a combination of markups, styling,

62
00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.850
and logic, which you can then use

63
00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:27.270
to build the overall user interface.

64
00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:30.780
And therefore you can break complex user interfaces

65
00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:35.780
up into simpler parts and then compose them together again.

66
00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:37.620
But by breaking everything up

67
00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:40.050
into those simpler building blocks,

68
00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:42.570
you can also break up complex problems

69
00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:47.070
and reduce the complexity of the overall web user interface

70
00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:50.824
and therefore simplify the development process.

71
00:03:50.824 --> 00:03:54.360
In addition, of course, since you do work

72
00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.220
with multiple such Components,

73
00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:57.780
you also make it easier

74
00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:00.780
to work on complex applications in a team,

75
00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:04.920
since it's easier to assign different team members

76
00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:06.900
to different parts of the UI

77
00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.903
since you have those different Components anyways.

78
00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:15.890
Another crucial feature Angular brings to the table

79
00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:18.960
is that it embraces some, not all,

80
00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:22.500
but some object oriented programming concepts

81
00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.240
and principles.

82
00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:28.500
Now, you don't have to know object oriented programming

83
00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.570
or be an expert there.

84
00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:32.430
You will learn everything you need

85
00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:34.350
to know throughout this course,

86
00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:38.174
but by giving you features like dependency injection

87
00:04:38.174 --> 00:04:41.748
or classes, Angular gives you tools

88
00:04:41.748 --> 00:04:46.142
that can make it a bit easier to build complex

89
00:04:46.142 --> 00:04:50.190
and scalable web applications.

90
00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:53.298
And then there's one last tool,

91
00:04:53.298 --> 00:04:56.282
one last thing Angular gives you,

92
00:04:56.282 --> 00:04:59.070
which can also help with the development

93
00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:03.240
of possibly complex web user interfaces.

94
00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:05.760
And that would be TypeScript.

95
00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:10.590
Angular uses TypeScript, not Vanilla JavaScript.

96
00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:12.750
So as an Angular developer,

97
00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:17.193
you actually write TypeScript code, not JavaScript code.

98
00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:21.240
Now, the good news is you don't need to know TypeScript

99
00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:22.320
for this course.

100
00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:24.840
You'll learn it all along the way

101
00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:28.710
because in the end, TypeScript just is JavaScript

102
00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:32.820
with strict and strong typing added to it,

103
00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:34.560
so that you, for example,

104
00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:37.310
can't easily switch the type of a value or,

105
00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:40.645
and that's the advantage of using TypeScript,

106
00:05:40.645 --> 00:05:45.270
that it's easier to catch simple errors

107
00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:47.520
where you might be working with a value

108
00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:49.967
that's not necessarily set yet,

109
00:05:49.967 --> 00:05:53.670
or where you might be passing the wrong kind of value

110
00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:56.550
to a certain function or method.

111
00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:58.590
And without TypeScript,

112
00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:01.492
those errors would be undetected

113
00:06:01.492 --> 00:06:05.940
and would then possibly only surface at runtime

114
00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:07.740
when your application crashes

115
00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:10.170
or behaves incorrectly,

116
00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:12.120
with the usage of TypeScript,

117
00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:14.490
you can instead catch them early on

118
00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:16.680
during the development process,

119
00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:19.320
hence leading to better code quality

120
00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:22.950
and possibly less errors in your code.

121
00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:26.550
And that's why Angular does embrace TypeScript

122
00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:28.617
and why as a Angular developer,

123
00:06:28.617 --> 00:06:31.410
you have to work with TypeScript.

124
00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:34.380
But as mentioned, that's not something to worry about.

125
00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:37.500
You'll learn it all step by step throughout this course

126
00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:39.603
as you are learning Angular.
