00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.480
- Now, the question is, how will this course

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:06.060
- teach you Angular?

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:09.000
- What can you expect from this course?

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.260
- And of course, you can simply take a

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:14.600
- look at the course curriculum and dive

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.320
- into the sections that are most

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:17.440
- interesting to you.

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.080
- That is an option.

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:22.520
- But the main idea behind this course is

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:25.840
- in the end that we'll first dive into the

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:26.380
- essentials.

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:29.400
- So there are a couple of sections that

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.220
- cover and practice the important

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:33.660
- Angular essentials.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.420
- So all the core Angular concepts you will

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:39.860
- very likely need, no matter on which

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:42.060
- kind of project you'll be working on.

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.240
- Before we then thereafter dive way

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:47.200
- deeper into Angular.

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.060
- So after the first couple of essentials

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:53.360
- sections, we'll have many deep dive

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.040
- sections where we'll take a deep dive

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.180
- into components, directives, pipes,

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:00.960
- services, and dependency injection and

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.660
- much, much more.

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:04.540
- That's the main structure.

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:06.540
- And therefore, of course, you'll get the

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.980
- most out of this course if you follow that

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:10.640
- structure.

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.140
- So if you take the course section by

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.940
- section, lecture by lecture, but the

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:18.740
- course is also built such that you can

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.320
- also skip sections and directly dive into

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.540
- the sections that are most interesting to

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.640
- you if you already have some Angular

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:28.400
- knowledge.

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.120
- Obviously, skipping the essentials

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:33.660
- sections won't be a good idea if you

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:35.760
- don't have that basic Angular

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:36.260
- knowledge.

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.320
- But if you do have it, you can of course

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.100
- go ahead and dive right into the services

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.740
- section if that's what you're interested in.

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:49.060
- It's also worth noting that this course in

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.240
- the end is, you could say, the

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.140
- combination of two courses because I

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.280
- completely rerecorded and updated this

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.860
- course to cover modern Angular

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.100
- features like standalone components

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.140
- and signals right from the start.

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:07.480
- And you'll learn all about them

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:08.820
- throughout this course, of course.

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:12.520
- But I also decided to keep an older

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.460
- version of this course around because

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:18.400
- there still are many projects out there

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.520
- that do use older Angular versions.

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.420
- And therefore, if you want to learn about

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.440
- the latest and greatest and most

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.700
- modern way of writing Angular code,

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.240
- you can simply keep on watching the

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.580
- videos.

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.940
- You can continue with the next lectures

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.820
- because the more modern sections and

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:37.280
- lectures come first.

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:40.620
- But if you know that you'll be working on

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.120
- a project that does not use signals and

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.120
- that does not necessarily use standalone

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.020
- components, if you know that this is the

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:53.000
- case, you can instead jump ahead to the

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.440
- older Angular essentials, to the old

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.680
- Angular basics and attached you find a

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.880
- link that will take you right to that

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:03.920
- section and start there.

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:07.120
- For most students, I recommend not

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:07.700
- doing that.

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.080
- But if you know that you'll need that

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:11.800
- knowledge, that you'll be working on

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.600
- such an older project, that attached link

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:15.740
- is for you.
