WEBVTT

00:00:00.459 --> 00:00:03.440
Now, in order to get started writing

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:05.979
Angular code and in order to learn

00:00:06.199 --> 00:00:08.800
Angular, we of course need an

00:00:08.939 --> 00:00:11.919
Angular project where we can put

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:14.199
that code in which we can run and test.

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:17.399
And here it turns out that you can't

00:00:17.579 --> 00:00:20.559
just create an empty folder and

00:00:20.719 --> 00:00:23.359
add an HTML file and maybe a

00:00:23.459 --> 00:00:26.059
JavaScript file or something like that.

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:28.739
And the reason for that is that when you

00:00:28.899 --> 00:00:31.739
write Angular code, when you build an

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:34.440
Angular project, you'll use many

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.459
features that don't work like that in

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.459
the browser out of the box.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Angular uses a certain

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:45.180
syntax in the HTML code, for example,

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.939
which is nonstandard, and it, for

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:50.919
example, also uses TypeScript, as

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:53.940
I mentioned before. So you need to write
TypeScript code,

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.159
which isn't difficult. As you will see, you

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.500
don't need to know it in order to take this
course,

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.239
but it doesn't work in the browser

00:01:02.459 --> 00:01:04.699
out of the box. It needs to be converted to

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:07.659
JavaScript. And for all these reasons,

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.760
since these things don't work out of the box like

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.539
that in the browser, you need to create an

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:16.579
Angular project that comes with certain

00:01:16.679 --> 00:01:19.380
tools that translate that

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.399
code, that compile that code to a code

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.439
that does run in the browser. And along the way,
it

00:01:25.499 --> 00:01:28.380
also would be nice if that code would then also

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.279
be optimized, and that's why

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:33.999
the Angular team created the

00:01:34.199 --> 00:01:36.499
Angular CLI, the Angular

00:01:36.599 --> 00:01:39.420
command-line interface, which is a

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.199
tool that simplifies the process

00:01:42.279 --> 00:01:44.859
of creating Angular projects,

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:47.839
but which is also a tool that's then in the end

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:50.260
used behind the scenes by those projects

00:01:50.699 --> 00:01:53.479
whenever you run your development testing

00:01:53.499 --> 00:01:56.179
server or when you build your app for production

00:01:56.639 --> 00:01:59.499
to perform those mentioned compilations and

00:01:59.599 --> 00:02:02.379
optimizations. So it's a crucial tool

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:05.059
you'll work with all the time as an Angular

00:02:05.099 --> 00:02:08.059
developer, though most of the time you'll just

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:10.479
use it behind the scenes automatically.

00:02:11.179 --> 00:02:14.139
Nonetheless, you need to install it in order to

00:02:14.159 --> 00:02:16.819
create Angular projects and in order to

00:02:16.839 --> 00:02:19.779
work on those projects. Now, attached you'll find
a

00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:22.459
link to this Angular CLI page,

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:25.479
and there in the local setup

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:28.499
area, you'll learn how to install the

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:31.439
Angular CLI and how to then use it, though

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:34.399
I'll show you the crucial basic usage you'll need

00:02:34.479 --> 00:02:37.259
for this course and for most Angular projects in

00:02:37.279 --> 00:02:40.119
this course, of course. We'll also

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:42.639
dive a bit deeper into the Angular

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:45.279
CLI and what you can do with it in later

00:02:45.399 --> 00:02:48.079
sections. To get started and

00:02:48.179 --> 00:02:51.079
create an Angular project, you as a first step

00:02:51.139 --> 00:02:53.779
need to install the CLI with help of this

00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:56.519
command, and for this command to

00:02:56.539 --> 00:02:59.239
work, you actually need to install another

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:01.759
tool first. And this

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:04.399
other tool, if you wanna call it like this,

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:07.059
would be NodeJS, which is a

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:09.939
JavaScript runtime that allows you to run

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:11.939
JavaScript outside of the browser.

00:03:12.839 --> 00:03:15.759
Now, we don't need it because we didn't write

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:18.379
any NodeJS code in this course.

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:21.419
Angular is not a NodeJS framework.

00:03:21.419 --> 00:03:24.059
It's a browser site framework in the end.

00:03:25.059 --> 00:03:27.199
But the Angular CLI

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:30.399
actually needs NodeJS in order to work,

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:33.579
and you also need NPM, the package

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:36.519
manager that comes together with NodeJS

00:03:36.839 --> 00:03:39.759
in order to execute this command and

00:03:39.779 --> 00:03:41.259
install Angular.

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:43.999
Therefore, you should visit

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:46.559
nodejs.org, and from

00:03:46.619 --> 00:03:49.319
there, download the LTS version,

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:52.339
whichever version that might be at the point of
time

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:54.999
you're viewing this, and once you did

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:57.959
download it, go through its installer, and here

00:03:57.979 --> 00:04:00.959
I'm using macOS, but it will automatically
download

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:03.619
the right installer for the operating system
you're

00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:06.599
using. Of course, you can follow along on Windows
as

00:04:06.619 --> 00:04:09.219
well. It's not a macOS-only

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:11.939
tool, and Angular also works on all

00:04:12.039 --> 00:04:14.519
operating systems. So walk through that

00:04:14.539 --> 00:04:17.479
installer and basically confirm all those

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:20.319
defaults, and once you then completed

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:23.439
that installation, you'll then have NodeJS and

00:04:23.519 --> 00:04:26.199
also this NPM tool installed on your

00:04:26.339 --> 00:04:29.299
system. And with that, you're then ready to

00:04:29.339 --> 00:04:32.019
execute this command and install the Angular

00:04:32.159 --> 00:04:34.819
CLI. So that's what I'll do next. I'll

00:04:34.879 --> 00:04:37.739
copy this command, and then with

00:04:37.799 --> 00:04:40.519
that command copied, you should open the default

00:04:40.539 --> 00:04:43.379
system terminal or command prompt on Windows

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:46.599
and execute that command there, though on

00:04:46.679 --> 00:04:49.419
macOS and Linux, you might need to add

00:04:49.559 --> 00:04:52.099
pseudo in front of this command to give it the
right

00:04:52.119 --> 00:04:54.959
permissions, and you might be

00:04:54.959 --> 00:04:57.919
prompted for your password. On Windows, pseudo is

00:04:57.999 --> 00:04:59.679
not needed and won't work there.

00:05:00.999 --> 00:05:03.259
So that will now install this Angular

00:05:03.439 --> 00:05:05.759
CLI, this command line interface

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:08.279
globally on our system.

00:05:09.659 --> 00:05:12.039
And with it installed, you're now ready to

00:05:12.239 --> 00:05:15.159
finally create a new Angular project.

00:05:15.579 --> 00:05:18.419
For that, you should navigate in your terminal

00:05:18.519 --> 00:05:21.379
or command prompt into the folder where you wanna

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:23.559
create that Angular project,

00:05:24.599 --> 00:05:27.459
and once you're there, you can create that project

00:05:27.559 --> 00:05:30.079
by running the NG new command.

00:05:32.039 --> 00:05:34.719
This NG command here is now

00:05:34.739 --> 00:05:37.439
available with the Angular CLI installed,

00:05:37.839 --> 00:05:40.779
and the new command is then a command supported by
the

00:05:40.859 --> 00:05:43.599
NG command in the end to create a new

00:05:43.739 --> 00:05:46.659
Angular project. You now also

00:05:46.679 --> 00:05:49.379
need to give that project a name, for example,

00:05:49.459 --> 00:05:52.039
first-Angular-app.

00:05:52.839 --> 00:05:55.759
And the name can be anything you like, but you

00:05:55.799 --> 00:05:58.459
should not include white space into that

00:05:58.499 --> 00:06:01.299
name, and it's also a good convention

00:06:01.399 --> 00:06:04.339
to keep it all lowercase and simply separate

00:06:04.419 --> 00:06:07.039
different words with dashes, as you see it

00:06:07.079 --> 00:06:09.879
here. You can then hit

00:06:09.999 --> 00:06:12.959
enter and you'll get asked a couple of questions.

00:06:13.099 --> 00:06:15.939
Depending on the Angular version or the

00:06:16.119 --> 00:06:18.799
Angular CLI version you're using on your

00:06:18.879 --> 00:06:21.599
system, you, for example, might get asked

00:06:21.759 --> 00:06:24.059
whether you want to create a zoneless

00:06:24.319 --> 00:06:27.019
Angular application or not. For

00:06:27.159 --> 00:06:30.059
older versions, you won't get this question, and
you can

00:06:30.179 --> 00:06:32.839
just confirm the default, which when I'm recording

00:06:32.859 --> 00:06:35.679
this, is no. In the future, it might be

00:06:35.999 --> 00:06:38.959
yes. And either way, you'll write Angular

00:06:39.059 --> 00:06:41.859
code as you learn it in this course. This

00:06:41.979 --> 00:06:44.739
option would just change how the Angular

00:06:44.779 --> 00:06:47.659
application is built and optimized behind the
scenes,

00:06:47.659 --> 00:06:50.639
and I'll get back to zoneless Angular later in
this

00:06:50.679 --> 00:06:53.599
course. You'll also get some other questions,

00:06:53.719 --> 00:06:56.639
for example, which stylesheet format you would
like to use.

00:06:57.019 --> 00:06:59.939
So if you wanna use plain CSS for styling or

00:07:00.119 --> 00:07:03.059
SASS or SCSS, and here I'll go

00:07:03.139 --> 00:07:05.119
for the plain CSS option.

00:07:06.379 --> 00:07:08.699
You might also get asked if you wanna enable

00:07:08.859 --> 00:07:11.219
server-side rendering and static site

00:07:11.299 --> 00:07:14.039
generation, and it doesn't matter too much what
you

00:07:14.159 --> 00:07:16.839
choose here, but here I'll actually enter N for no

00:07:16.859 --> 00:07:19.719
here. We'll dive into server-side rendering and

00:07:19.719 --> 00:07:22.499
what that is later in the course, but for the
moment, I'll pick

00:07:22.619 --> 00:07:25.599
no, and that will then go

00:07:25.679 --> 00:07:28.419
ahead and create this project. You might get asked

00:07:28.439 --> 00:07:31.299
more questions because those change from

00:07:31.319 --> 00:07:34.219
time to time, but in that case, you can always
confirm the

00:07:34.299 --> 00:07:36.799
default choice by simply hitting enter,

00:07:37.659 --> 00:07:40.479
and ultimately this new project should therefore
be

00:07:40.479 --> 00:07:41.199
created.
