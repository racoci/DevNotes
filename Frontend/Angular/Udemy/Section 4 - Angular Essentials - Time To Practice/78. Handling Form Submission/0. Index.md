00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.190
<v ->[Maximilian Schwarzmüller] So let's now handle</v>

2
00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:04.560
the submission of this forum.

3
00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.330
And for that I'll go to my user input component HTML file,

4
00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.160
and they are on the forum.

5
00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.850
We can listen to an event about which you learned earlier

6
00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:17.010
in the essentials section.

7
00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.043
We can listen to the ngSubmit event,

8
00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.910
or at least we almost can.

9
00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.410
Right now I can't

10
00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.250
because this is not a default browser event.

11
00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.130
Instead, this is an event that's triggered

12
00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.839
four form elements by Angular,

13
00:00:35.839 --> 00:00:40.839
but only after we imported and unlocked, so to say,

14
00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.760
a certain Angular feature.

15
00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.050
To be precise in the component that wants to use ngSubmit,

16
00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.050
we have to add the forms module to our imports array here,

17
00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:57.180
and to make it available in this file,

18
00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.340
we actually also have to add

19
00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.873
the import at the top of the file from @Angular forms.

20
00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.090
This module includes a couple of important things.

21
00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.260
For example, an extension of the default form element,

22
00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.730
if you want to call it like this,

23
00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:18.090
that unlocks this ngSubmit event.

24
00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.560
So now we can listen to that

25
00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.993
with that event binding syntax here.

26
00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.490
Now I also of course, need to define what should happen

27
00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.230
when that event occurs,

28
00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:31.620
and here I want to add a new method

29
00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:35.190
to that user input component class.

30
00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:36.930
onSubmit could be the name,

31
00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.540
though, of course the name is up to you.

32
00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.460
And with that method added

33
00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.360
in the template of this component where we added the method,

34
00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.563
we can now call onSubmit when that event occurs.

35
00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:52.443
So that's how we connect this.

36
00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.340
Now to see whether this works or not,

37
00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.300
Inside of onSubmit, we can console log,

38
00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:02.373
submit it, for example.

39
00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.830
With that added, if you open the developer tools

40
00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:10.410
and they are the JavaScript console,

41
00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.913
if you click calculate, now you should see submitted here.

42
00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.650
So that's an important step in the right direction.

43
00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.370
As a next step, I want to use two-way binding

44
00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.470
to get hold of the values

45
00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.083
that have been entered into these fields.
