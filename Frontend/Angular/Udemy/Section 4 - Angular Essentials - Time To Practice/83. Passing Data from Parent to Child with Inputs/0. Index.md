00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.590
<v ->[Maximilian Schwarzmüller] Now actually,</v>

2
00:00:01.590 --> 00:00:04.740
before I'll output the annual data here

3
00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.670
in a table on the screen, I'll do something else.

4
00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:13.110
I'll outsource this type definition here into a model,

5
00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.000
which is not something you have to do,

6
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.580
but something that can make your code a bit leaner

7
00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.040
and easier to reuse.

8
00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:23.943
For that, I'll add a new file here in my app folder,

9
00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.080
and I'll name it investment-input.model.ts.

10
00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:31.800
The file name is up to you,

11
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.290
but of course it should describe what's inside of it,

12
00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.450
and it should follow this convention

13
00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.280
of having this description

14
00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.060
of which kind of thing you'll store in that file

15
00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:44.460
if it's a component, a service,

16
00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.443
or in this case a data model.

17
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.190
Now model is a big word here though.

18
00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.060
In the end in there, I want to create a custom object type

19
00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:58.440
with help of this interface keyword provided by TypeScript,

20
00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.860
which I'll name investment input

21
00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:04.563
to be in line with my file name here,

22
00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.970
and then I'll paste in that object type

23
00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.773
as we defined it earlier.

24
00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.440
Alternatively, instead of using an interface,

25
00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.230
you could have also used the type keyword

26
00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:22.743
to create this type, like this.

27
00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:26.160
It's up to you what you want to use.

28
00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:27.990
Here, I'll go for the interface

29
00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.690
since that's the approach you'll see a bit more often

30
00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:33.243
in Angular projects in my experience.

31
00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.190
Now we definitely need to export it.

32
00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:41.100
We also would need to do that with the custom type

33
00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.710
to make it available outside of this file,

34
00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.000
because the idea now is to import this custom type

35
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.353
in all the places where such a object type is expected.

36
00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:55.680
So in the app component TypeScript file,

37
00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.790
I'll now replace this object type definition here

38
00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.750
by using my investment input type.

39
00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.570
And for that we must import it

40
00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.090
and we can add the type keyword in front of it

41
00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.570
to make it clear that this is just a type definition.

42
00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:14.790
And we then assign it as a type here

43
00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.713
for this data parameter.

44
00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.180
And it's now not just here where we can use it,

45
00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.410
but also in the user input component TypeScript file,

46
00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.660
there on this event emitter,

47
00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.463
it's now also this investment input type that we can use.

48
00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:37.770
And here we also must make sure that this import was added

49
00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:41.643
and we can add this type addition here to the import.

50
00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:48.483
With that, of course, the program will still work as before,

51
00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.380
but we made our code a bit leaner.

52
00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.600
But now I wanna make sure that the data

53
00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.853
is actually also output on the screen.
