WEBVTT

00:00:00.479 --> 00:00:03.059
So to dive into all those crucial

00:00:03.079 --> 00:00:05.799
essentials and build this demo project, I

00:00:05.859 --> 00:00:08.819
prepared a new starting project and

00:00:08.819 --> 00:00:11.659
you find a link to it attached. And I do

00:00:11.699 --> 00:00:14.539
recommend that you use it so that we all have the

00:00:14.679 --> 00:00:17.259
same starting state. And it is a

00:00:17.299 --> 00:00:19.979
project that has been created with the

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:23.040
Angular CLI. And as you

00:00:23.059 --> 00:00:25.620
can tell, such a project then comes with

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:28.940
a bunch of configuration files and also

00:00:28.979 --> 00:00:31.760
an SRC folder, which then contains more

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.880
files and folders inside of it.

00:00:34.779 --> 00:00:37.599
Now, one thing you might see if you create a

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:40.459
new project with the CLI, depending on the

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:43.520
CLI version you are using, is that such newly

00:00:43.599 --> 00:00:46.120
created projects come with a public folder,

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:49.259
which contains a favicon file, which

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.380
in the attached project doesn't exist.

00:00:51.639 --> 00:00:54.139
There, the favicon file is stored in the

00:00:54.259 --> 00:00:56.919
SRC folder. Now, small

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:59.920
differences like this exist because different

00:00:59.959 --> 00:01:02.859
CLI versions create different starting

00:01:02.939 --> 00:01:05.779
projects. Of course, the Angular code you write is

00:01:05.819 --> 00:01:08.479
the same, it's just small differences like

00:01:08.559 --> 00:01:11.540
where you might wanna store, uh, image assets like

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:14.540
that favicon. That's why I provide that

00:01:14.559 --> 00:01:17.279
starting project so that we do all have the same

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.099
starting state. Of course, as I just said, the

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:22.940
code we write will always be the same no matter

00:01:22.959 --> 00:01:25.739
which exact project structure you might have.

00:01:26.139 --> 00:01:28.819
And now to get started, I quickly wanna walk

00:01:28.879 --> 00:01:31.600
you through the files and folders we have here

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:34.659
because it is, of course, important to understand

00:01:35.059 --> 00:01:37.780
why we have all those files and what they're
doing.

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:41.719
Now, the files you find in the root level, so

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:44.219
in the top level of your project, are

00:01:44.279 --> 00:01:46.980
essentially all configuration files.

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:49.899
We got some configuration files for

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.100
TypeScript, and you shouldn't change them unless

00:01:53.139 --> 00:01:55.920
you know what you're doing. The defaults should be

00:01:55.939 --> 00:01:58.580
fine here, because these files simply

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.579
control how exactly the TypeScript

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:04.439
code will be compiled to JavaScript

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:07.399
code under the hood. The compilation

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:10.059
will be triggered automatically by the

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:12.979
Angular CLI, so you don't have to do that

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:15.679
manually, but these files control how that

00:02:15.719 --> 00:02:18.379
works and also how strict TypeScript

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:20.959
is, how quickly it complains about

00:02:20.979 --> 00:02:23.939
potential errors, and so on. Then

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:26.879
we have these package files here, which in the

00:02:26.899 --> 00:02:29.319
end manage the dependencies of your

00:02:29.719 --> 00:02:32.539
application. And here you mostly find

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:35.339
all those Angular packages, which of course

00:02:35.339 --> 00:02:37.759
are dependencies because we will use

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:40.799
features from these packages in our code.

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:43.919
Then we get this angular.json

00:02:43.939 --> 00:02:46.199
file, which contains extra

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:49.279
configuration settings for the Angular

00:02:49.419 --> 00:02:50.579
CLI and

00:02:51.119 --> 00:02:53.879
Angular-provided tools in general.

00:02:54.179 --> 00:02:57.119
And just as with the TypeScript configuration,

00:02:57.499 --> 00:03:00.419
you typically don't need to change anything here

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:03.299
in this angular.json file unless you know what

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:06.159
you're doing, and we'll take a closer look at

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:08.739
this configuration file a little bit later in the

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:11.359
course. And then we also have these two

00:03:11.399 --> 00:03:14.359
configuration files here where the editorConfig

00:03:14.499 --> 00:03:17.119
contains some rules for the code editor

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:19.719
regarding, um, how the code should be

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:22.739
formatted and so on. And the.gitignore file

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:25.779
is relevant if you're using Git for version
control.

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:29.639
And then we have this SRC folder, which is the

00:03:29.999 --> 00:03:32.759
important folder in this project because

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:35.519
it's in this folder, or specifically

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:37.859
actually in the app folder in this

00:03:38.119 --> 00:03:40.999
SRC folder, where you will spend most

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:43.719
of your time, because it's here where you will

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:46.319
build your Angular components and write your

00:03:46.439 --> 00:03:49.099
Angular code. Now, I will say,

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:51.679
just as mentioned before, that depending on which

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:54.799
Angular CLI version you used for creating

00:03:54.799 --> 00:03:57.019
this project, you might find

00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:00.259
files in this app folder that are named a little
bit

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:02.959
differently. For example, you might have an

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:05.659
app.TS file in there instead of an

00:04:05.659 --> 00:04:08.619
app.component TS file. The

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:10.779
idea behind the file will always be the same.

00:04:10.779 --> 00:04:13.639
It will hold a so-called component, and we will
learn

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:16.339
what that is in this course, of course, but the

00:04:16.399 --> 00:04:19.299
naming changed over the different Angular

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:22.039
versions. However, for basically all

00:04:22.359 --> 00:04:25.079
Angular versions since the release of

00:04:25.119 --> 00:04:28.019
Angular 2 many years ago, this

00:04:28.239 --> 00:04:30.239
naming pattern, which you see here,

00:04:30.619 --> 00:04:33.559
app.component.something, has

00:04:33.619 --> 00:04:36.379
been the default, and that default only changed

00:04:36.439 --> 00:04:39.259
with the release of Angular 20. You can

00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:42.239
name your files whatever you want. The name has no
impact

00:04:42.259 --> 00:04:44.839
on the code you write or the behavior of Angular.

00:04:45.239 --> 00:04:48.119
I'm just mentioning this here so that you don't
wonder why

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:51.039
in this course and in most projects you'll see

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:53.619
components that carry dot component in their

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:56.479
filename, whereas in new Angular projects,

00:04:56.519 --> 00:04:59.319
you might not have that dot component part here.

00:04:59.499 --> 00:05:01.959
You can add it, you can ignore it. That is up to
you.

00:05:02.399 --> 00:05:04.899
I'm just mentioning it here so that you don't
wonder about the

00:05:04.899 --> 00:05:07.879
difference in filenames. Now, in this

00:05:07.959 --> 00:05:10.919
SRC folder, you find a bunch of files right inside

00:05:10.939 --> 00:05:13.639
of it, like the style CSS file, which

00:05:13.779 --> 00:05:16.759
sets up some global styles that will apply to the

00:05:16.799 --> 00:05:19.279
entire web application across all

00:05:19.359 --> 00:05:22.059
components. You find an index

00:05:22.059 --> 00:05:24.979
HTML file, which is the main HTML

00:05:25.019 --> 00:05:27.759
file that will be loaded when visitors

00:05:27.779 --> 00:05:30.719
visit your website, and we'll get back to this
file and

00:05:30.779 --> 00:05:33.259
why it's important in just a second. We got a

00:05:33.379 --> 00:05:36.199
favicon and then this main.TS file,

00:05:36.319 --> 00:05:39.119
which is a.TS file because it's actually

00:05:39.139 --> 00:05:41.699
containing TypeScript code, and it's an

00:05:41.719 --> 00:05:44.099
important file because it will be the

00:05:44.119 --> 00:05:46.959
first code file, so to say, to be

00:05:46.979 --> 00:05:49.959
executed when your Angular application

00:05:49.979 --> 00:05:52.439
loads up in the browsers of your

00:05:52.459 --> 00:05:55.299
visitors. So the code in this file will be the
first

00:05:55.319 --> 00:05:58.259
code to be executed, and we'll also get back to
that

00:05:58.259 --> 00:06:01.179
in a second. And then we got the assets

00:06:01.199 --> 00:06:04.119
folder where you could store images that should be
used,

00:06:04.179 --> 00:06:07.099
like this logo, which I'm actually already using
in that

00:06:07.139 --> 00:06:10.079
starting project I provided to you, and

00:06:10.119 --> 00:06:12.959
the app folder in which you will spend most of
your

00:06:12.979 --> 00:06:15.759
time because it's in this folder where you will

00:06:15.779 --> 00:06:18.119
build and combine all those Angular

00:06:18.199 --> 00:06:20.959
components. Now, as you might have seen,

00:06:21.139 --> 00:06:23.939
I'm getting some error here in the main.TS file,
and

00:06:23.959 --> 00:06:26.919
that's happening because at this point I actually
haven't

00:06:26.959 --> 00:06:29.879
installed all those dependencies that are
mentioned in the

00:06:29.879 --> 00:06:32.819
package.JASON file yet, and therefore to do

00:06:32.879 --> 00:06:35.579
that, what you should do after downloading that

00:06:35.679 --> 00:06:38.439
starting code snapshot is open your

00:06:38.559 --> 00:06:41.459
default command prompt or terminal and navigate

00:06:41.479 --> 00:06:44.259
into this folder, and then run NPM

00:06:44.279 --> 00:06:46.699
install in there. This will install all those

00:06:46.739 --> 00:06:49.499
dependencies, and you only need to do this once,

00:06:49.919 --> 00:06:52.599
not every time you start working on the project
again,

00:06:52.979 --> 00:06:55.219
only once so that you have all those

00:06:55.279 --> 00:06:58.159
dependencies. And you can ignore any warnings you

00:06:58.179 --> 00:07:00.959
might be getting there. As long as it finished
without an

00:07:01.039 --> 00:07:03.939
error, you're good to go. And good

00:07:04.019 --> 00:07:06.939
to go then means that as a next step, you

00:07:06.979 --> 00:07:09.579
can start that development server that

00:07:09.599 --> 00:07:12.419
allows you to preview the application on which
you're

00:07:12.459 --> 00:07:15.419
working in the browser. And you can do that by

00:07:15.559 --> 00:07:18.279
simply running NPM Start in this project,

00:07:18.439 --> 00:07:21.079
because under the hood this will actually execute

00:07:21.239 --> 00:07:23.799
NG serve, so it will use the Angular

00:07:23.939 --> 00:07:26.779
CLI under the hood, and it will then spin

00:07:26.819 --> 00:07:29.639
up that development server, which allows you to

00:07:29.659 --> 00:07:32.439
preview the website under that address that's
being output

00:07:32.479 --> 00:07:35.259
here. And when you then visit this address here,

00:07:35.499 --> 00:07:38.339
you should see this site on your screen.

00:07:38.339 --> 00:07:40.999
And in the next lecture, we'll now explore how

00:07:41.059 --> 00:07:43.839
exactly this content ends up on our

00:07:43.919 --> 00:07:44.359
screen.
