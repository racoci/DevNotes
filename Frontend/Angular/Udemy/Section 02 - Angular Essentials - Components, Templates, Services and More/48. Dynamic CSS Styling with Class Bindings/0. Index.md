00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:04.890
<v Maximilian>So now we're able to select different users</v>

2
00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:06.660
and see their tasks.

3
00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.460
But, of course, the Add Task

4
00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.100
and Complete buttons don't do anything yet,

5
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:13.860
and that's therefore what we'll add next.

6
00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.540
However, before we do that,

7
00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.106
there's one other improvement I'd like to make

8
00:00:19.106 --> 00:00:21.300
on this application.

9
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.980
I'd like to make it very clear which user was selected.

10
00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.200
Sure, we can see the name here,

11
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.300
but if we scroll down, for example,

12
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.910
we don't really see it anymore.

13
00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.540
And it would simply be nice if the currently active user

14
00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.240
would be highlighted here on the left,

15
00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:43.740
and we can implement this feature by going

16
00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:48.150
to the user.component.html file,

17
00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:52.200
or to the user.component.css file actually first.

18
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:56.610
And in there, you'll see that I prepared a CSS class,

19
00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.750
an active class that could be added to an element

20
00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.973
to give it this highlighted look.

21
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:08.670
So in order to make a user look highlighted

22
00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.670
and selected, we should conditionally add that CSS class

23
00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.470
to that button here if the user is selected.

24
00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.080
Therefore, as a first step, we need

25
00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.060
to find out whether a user is selected or not,

26
00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.160
and we actually already have

27
00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.610
that information in the app.component.

28
00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.533
There we know which user with which ID is selected,

29
00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:42.393
and we then even compute the selectedUser like this.

30
00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:47.910
Therefore, to implement this highlighting feature,

31
00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:51.870
we can go back to the user.component TypeScript file

32
00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:55.980
and add another new input here,

33
00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:59.290
an input property that I'll name selected

34
00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.850
and the type should be boolean.

35
00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.983
So true or false,

36
00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.980
I also wanna make this required

37
00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:14.280
so that it must be set and therefore,

38
00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:15.930
I can add this exclamation mark

39
00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.933
to convince TypeScript that this will be set.

40
00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.433
Now, back in the app.component template,

41
00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.770
we have to add this selected property here

42
00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:31.440
and set it equal to true or false.

43
00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.410
And of course, I wanna dynamically derive whether it's true

44
00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:39.150
or false, and that's fairly straightforward to do

45
00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:40.200
because as mentioned,

46
00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:45.200
we're storing the selectedUserId here in the app.component.

47
00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:48.000
And in the app.component template,

48
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.820
we're looping through all users.

49
00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:53.490
So selected will be true if the ID

50
00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:57.030
of the user we're currently looking at in this loop

51
00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:00.290
is equal to that selectedUserId.

52
00:03:01.926 --> 00:03:03.870
And otherwise, we'll get false here

53
00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.660
because it's then not the selected user

54
00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:07.863
we're outputting here.

55
00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.810
But with that, we're passing this selected property

56
00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:16.350
or this value for this selected property

57
00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:18.393
to this user.component.

58
00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:23.460
Now we can use this selected property in the template

59
00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:28.460
of this user.component to conditionally add that CSS class.

60
00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:34.290
And if you wanna add a class conditionally to an element,

61
00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:37.740
which is a rather common scenario, you can do that

62
00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:42.740
with a special binding, a special property binding syntax.

63
00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:47.220
Instead of binding the class property as a whole,

64
00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.167
you bind class.,

65
00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:53.880
and then the name of the class you wanna conditionally add,

66
00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:55.383
for example, active.

67
00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:00.270
And then you set this equal to a true or false value,

68
00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:03.960
which determines whether this class will be added.

69
00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:06.960
So in this case, the selected property,

70
00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:08.943
which holds true or false.

71
00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:12.150
And that's all.

72
00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:15.210
With that, this active CSS class is added

73
00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:17.763
to this button if selected is true.

74
00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.830
If we save that, you see initially nothing's selected,

75
00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:26.220
but if I click on a user, now you see it stays

76
00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:29.610
in that highlighted mode, not just when I hover over it,

77
00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:31.503
but also after I clicked on it.

78
00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.833
And that's now the behavior I want here.
