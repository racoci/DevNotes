00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.970
<v Maximilian>In this section, we're going</v>

2
00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.780
to dive into the crucial Angular Essentials,

3
00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:11.010
the core concepts every Angular developer must know

4
00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.240
and will do so by building a complete demo application

5
00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:16.560
from the ground up.

6
00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.860
And whilst building this demo application

7
00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:22.320
and all the features it offers,

8
00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.550
you will learn about the Angular project structure,

9
00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.550
so how Angular projects are structured

10
00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.690
and what the different files and folders in there do.

11
00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.380
You will learn about this important concept of working

12
00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.350
with components which I already mentioned

13
00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.690
in the first course section.

14
00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.310
And of course, you'll also learn

15
00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:47.280
about those other core concepts like TypeScript

16
00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.280
or writing declarative code.

17
00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.320
You will specifically also learn

18
00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.140
how to handle user events like clicks,

19
00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.720
so how you can react to those.

20
00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:01.860
And you will also learn how to write Angular code

21
00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:04.470
that gets Angular to render

22
00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.280
and update a dynamic user interface

23
00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.080
so that by the end of the section,

24
00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.473
you are able to build dynamic web applications

25
00:01:13.473 --> 00:01:15.180
like the demo app we're building

26
00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.193
in this section on your own.
