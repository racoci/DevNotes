00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
<v ->So in this section, you now learned a lot about Angular.</v>

2
00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.070
You actually learned all about the crucial essentials

3
00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:10.860
every Angular developer must know.

4
00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.680
You learned about Components, why they matter,

5
00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.260
and that the idea is that you build

6
00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.830
potentially complex user interfaces with Components.

7
00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.080
And you learned how to create Components.

8
00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.780
That there are classes that are decorated

9
00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:26.670
with that Component decorator,

10
00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.830
which then holds the configuration

11
00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.400
for a Component, like its identifier, you could say,

12
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.580
its selector, but also where to find the template

13
00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:37.260
or styles of a Component.

14
00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.180
Because a Component, in the end,

15
00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.050
is a custom HTML element, you could say.

16
00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.500
And the idea then is that you can use that element

17
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.170
in the templates of other Components

18
00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.560
so that you're building a Component tree in the end.

19
00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:55.500
Now these Components can then also talk to each other

20
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.170
with help of Inputs and Outputs.

21
00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.440
Inputs are, in the end, properties of a Component

22
00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.470
that can be set from outside that Component.

23
00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.660
So from inside the parent Component,

24
00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:09.450
which uses the other Component in its template.

25
00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:10.800
And Outputs are, in the end,

26
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.777
custom events that can be emitted

27
00:01:12.777 --> 00:01:14.700
and that can also contain data

28
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.790
so that a child Component can talk back

29
00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.170
to its parent Component

30
00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.290
and let it know about something that happened inside of it,

31
00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.330
which is a crucial feature.

32
00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.320
Now since things are happening in an Angular app,

33
00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.840
users might be clicking buttons and so on,

34
00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.240
it's also quite common that data changes

35
00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.470
in your Angular app,

36
00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.570
and therefore you might wanna output

37
00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.690
that dynamic data in the templates of your Components,

38
00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:43.500
which you can do with various template binding syntaxes

39
00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.650
like with string interpolation, which can be used to,

40
00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:49.440
for example, output the value stored in a property

41
00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:50.910
of your class.

42
00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:54.840
Or if you want to set a property of some DOM element,

43
00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.340
like the source of an image,

44
00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.710
you can do that with property binding.

45
00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.510
If you wanna listen to events,

46
00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:03.510
no matter if they're custom events or built-in events,

47
00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:05.310
you do that with event binding

48
00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.130
where you use these parentheses around the event name,

49
00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:09.600
and you then define the code

50
00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.450
that should be executed when the event occurs.

51
00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.870
By the way, a special kind of binding is two-way binding,

52
00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.170
which is typically used in conjunction with form inputs,

53
00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:20.220
which is unlocked

54
00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.370
by using this special two-way binding syntax

55
00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.500
on properties that support it.

56
00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:26.790
Most properties don't,

57
00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:30.540
but one property that does is the ngModel property,

58
00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.360
which is offered by the ngModel directive,

59
00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.550
which is available once you import it

60
00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:37.620
and unlock the FormsModule.

61
00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.870
You can then use the ngModel directive

62
00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.150
with its two-way binding syntax

63
00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.750
to set up this two-way communication on an Input element,

64
00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.690
for example, which allows you to listen to changes

65
00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:52.380
whilst also being able to send back data into the Input

66
00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.480
to update it, for example.

67
00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.330
Now coming back to data that changes,

68
00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.910
it's worth noting that by default,

69
00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:02.700
Angular watches for possible events

70
00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.740
that could lead to data changes

71
00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:07.590
and therefore UI changes automatically

72
00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:11.190
with help of an internal package called zone.js.

73
00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:12.570
And therefore, by default,

74
00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:15.630
all you have to do if you wanna update the UI

75
00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.370
is change some data,

76
00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:19.650
for example, after a button click,

77
00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:22.380
and output that data in the template

78
00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:25.650
with help of one of the template binding features,

79
00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:27.960
and Angular will figure out the rest,

80
00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:29.670
which is pretty convenient.

81
00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:33.300
You can, however, also use Signals instead

82
00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:36.420
where Angular is not automatically watching

83
00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:39.780
for all kinds of events that could lead to changes,

84
00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:43.950
but where you instead explicitly notify Angular

85
00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:46.020
about changes by, for example,

86
00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:49.410
calling the set method on a Signal value.

87
00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:52.950
And where Angular sets up a subscription

88
00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:55.020
whenever you read a Signal

89
00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:57.900
so that it knows which places of your app

90
00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.600
are interested in those data changes

91
00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:02.940
and should potentially be updated.

92
00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:06.300
And this, whilst being a bit more work for you,

93
00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:09.270
the developer, can therefore be a more efficient

94
00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:11.310
State management mechanism

95
00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:14.550
and can potentially lead to better performance.

96
00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:16.410
Though this Signals approach

97
00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:19.800
is only available since Angular version 16,

98
00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:22.140
and therefore in older Angular projects,

99
00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:24.210
you, for example, can't use it.

100
00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:27.150
Now it's also quite common that, for example,

101
00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:28.530
when some data changes,

102
00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:31.350
you wanna render some content conditionally

103
00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:33.180
only if a certain condition is met.

104
00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:35.100
And you can do that in Angular

105
00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:38.010
by using the @if template syntax,

106
00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:40.470
which also, however, is only available

107
00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:42.630
since Angular version 17.

108
00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:46.230
Before that, you had to use the special ngIf directive,

109
00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:48.900
which was a bit more clunky to use however,

110
00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:51.240
especially if you don't just have a if case,

111
00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:52.860
but also potentially some else

112
00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:55.710
or else if cases you want to handle.

113
00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:58.890
Also common is that you wanna output some list data,

114
00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:01.170
and you wanna repeat some part of the DOM

115
00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:04.170
for every element in an array, for example.

116
00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:07.590
This can be done with the @for template syntax,

117
00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:10.200
which makes it easy to loop through all the items

118
00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:12.660
in an array and output some markup

119
00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:14.760
for every element in that array.

120
00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:17.220
This feature is also only available

121
00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:19.080
since Angular version 17,

122
00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:21.570
and therefore in older Angular versions,

123
00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:24.660
you would use the ngFor directive instead.

124
00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:27.930
Other features we had a look at in this section were,

125
00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:31.050
for example, how to dynamically add or not add

126
00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:32.820
a CSS class to an element

127
00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:35.850
with help of that special class binding syntax.

128
00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:39.360
We also had a look at the special ng-content element,

129
00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:41.700
which is offered by Angular, which in the end,

130
00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:45.480
allows you to define a slot in the markup of a template

131
00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:47.670
that will be used to render the content

132
00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:50.130
that's passed between the tags of that Component,

133
00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:51.810
which can be really useful.

134
00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:54.570
And we also, for example, had a look at pipes,

135
00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:58.110
which make it easy to format and transform values

136
00:05:58.110 --> 00:05:59.730
you are outputting in the template,

137
00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:01.680
like for example, the date pipe,

138
00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:04.050
which can help with date formatting,

139
00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:06.870
another feature that's built into Angular.

140
00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:10.050
Another problem you commonly have to deal with

141
00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:13.080
is the submission of forms and how to handle that.

142
00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:16.410
And that's, again, a place where Angular helps you

143
00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:19.560
by giving you the special ngSubmit event

144
00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:21.000
to which you can listen,

145
00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.180
when using the forms module, I should say,

146
00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:27.480
which automatically prevents the browser's default,

147
00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:30.330
which would be to send an HTTP request

148
00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:32.640
to the server that served the website,

149
00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:35.760
which you typically don't want when building an Angular app,

150
00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:39.210
so that instead, you can then handle the form submission

151
00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:42.330
in the client side code, so in your Angular code,

152
00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:44.640
so that you have full control

153
00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:47.460
over how the form submission is handled.

154
00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:50.340
Well, and last but definitely not least,

155
00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:51.870
we had a look at Services,

156
00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:55.260
which is another crucial concept in Angular.

157
00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:58.260
To be precise, it's the combination of Services

158
00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:01.530
and Angular's dependency injection mechanism

159
00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:05.730
where the idea simply is that you can outsource data

160
00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:08.910
and logic from a Component into a Service

161
00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:12.570
and then inject that Service into all the Components

162
00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:14.640
that might be interested in the data

163
00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:17.910
or some of the methods exposed by the Service.

164
00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:21.990
You can inject that Service by decorating the Service class

165
00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:25.140
with the @Injectable decorator, which in the end,

166
00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:28.410
tells Angular that it should be aware of this Service,

167
00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:32.130
and that this is something you wanna inject somewhere.

168
00:07:32.130 --> 00:07:34.320
And you then do inject it either

169
00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:35.880
with help of the constructor

170
00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:38.520
by listing the Service as a dependency there,

171
00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:41.460
and it's the type annotation that's important here,

172
00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:44.400
or with help of the special inject function.

173
00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:47.460
And then the places where you injected the Service

174
00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:50.670
can use the entire API of that Service,

175
00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:54.630
which therefore makes sharing logic and data a breeze.

176
00:07:54.630 --> 00:07:58.830
So of course this section contained loads of content.

177
00:07:58.830 --> 00:08:00.630
It was a huge section,

178
00:08:00.630 --> 00:08:03.300
because there are many essential features

179
00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:04.800
you must be aware of.

180
00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:07.290
Now you can, of course, repeat that section

181
00:08:07.290 --> 00:08:09.630
as often as you want and as you need it

182
00:08:09.630 --> 00:08:11.760
so that you make sure that you really have

183
00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:13.170
that solid foundation.

184
00:08:13.170 --> 00:08:14.400
But you will, of course,

185
00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:18.960
also see all those fundamental concepts in Action again,

186
00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:22.320
over and over again throughout this entire course,

187
00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:23.940
in all the other sections,

188
00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:26.970
and in all the other demo projects we'll build.

189
00:08:26.970 --> 00:08:29.400
So there will be plenty of opportunities

190
00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:31.680
to work with these essentials.

191
00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:34.620
And therefore, we're now ready to take the next steps

192
00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:38.610
and dive deeper into those different core features

193
00:08:38.610 --> 00:08:42.990
Angular offers and also explore some more advanced concepts

194
00:08:42.990 --> 00:08:44.740
throughout the rest of this course.
