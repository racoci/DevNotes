<v ->[Maximilian Schwarzmüller] In the previous lecture,</v>

2
00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:04.500
you learned about state,

3
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.490
so about data stored in properties here,

4
00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.033
which when changed, has an impact on the UI.

5
00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.430
And that data change has an impact on the UI

6
00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.430
due to how Angular's change detection mechanism works.

7
00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.460
Because Angular automatically detects and finds out

8
00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.410
when data changes

9
00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.780
and it then simply takes a look at

10
00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:33.660
the template of the component

11
00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.870
and verifies whether that template,

12
00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.910
now that the data changed,

13
00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.140
maybe produces a different DOM snapshot.

14
00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.730
And if that's the case, it goes ahead and updates the UI

15
00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.180
so that changes are reflected there.

16
00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.210
Angular does all of that automatically,

17
00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.940
and it does all of that automatically

18
00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.060
with help of a part of the Angular framework

19
00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:03.000
that's called zone.js.

20
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.650
Now, Angular is using this zone.js thing under the hood.

21
00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.460
You don't need to use it yourself as an Angular developer,

22
00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.910
but it is interesting to understand how it works

23
00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:18.240
because what this zone.js thing,

24
00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.540
this part of the Angular framework does

25
00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.540
is that it automatically listens to all possible user events

26
00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.780
that could occur on a website, for example,

27
00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.800
as well as some other possible events that could occur,

28
00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:38.190
like a timer expiring or anything like that.

29
00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:40.290
And when such an event occurs,

30
00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:45.290
it checks the Angular application for possible changes.

31
00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.710
That's how change detection works in Angular in a nutshell.

32
00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.490
And that's why we got this almost magic behavior

33
00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.430
where we can simply change some data,

34
00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.160
some value stored in a property here,

35
00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.530
and the UI updates automatically

36
00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.923
without any extra work being required from our site.
