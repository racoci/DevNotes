00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:03.360
<v Maximilian>So we built our first custom component</v>

2
00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.030
from scratch, the header component.

3
00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:08.310
And that is something you'll do a lot

4
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:09.780
when working with Angular

5
00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.483
because you'll be working with a lot of Components.

6
00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.450
Now, as you can imagine,

7
00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.700
if you build more and more Components,

8
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:21.240
since most Components consist of multiple files,

9
00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.470
the app folder will grow rather quickly

10
00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.930
and managing all those component files

11
00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.020
can become rather cumbersome quickly.

12
00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:34.050
That's why it's common to put component files

13
00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.103
into subfolders inside of that src app folder.

14
00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:41.880
For example, here we could create a new subfolder

15
00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:45.543
called header for the header component files,

16
00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:48.780
and the convention is to use a folder name

17
00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.870
that just describes the feature

18
00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.343
the component is being used for, so the header in this case.

19
00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:00.270
So we could then grab these three files

20
00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.733
and move them into this header folder.

21
00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.560
Now with them moved, you should just make sure

22
00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.200
that in the app component TypeScript file,

23
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.833
this import path here is updated accordingly.

24
00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.390
Many IDEs and code editors will do that automatically,

25
00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.730
but you should double check to make sure

26
00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:23.610
that you are now importing the header component

27
00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.443
from that header folder.

28
00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.340
And with that, if you save everything,

29
00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.740
the app should still work as before,

30
00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.503
but now we have a better folder structure.

31
00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.350
That's not the only thing you can and should do

32
00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.653
to work with Components more efficiently.

33
00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.760
Instead, you can also use the Angular CLI

34
00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:52.170
to get some help with creating and managing Components

35
00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.500
because let's say we wanna add another component

36
00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:56.790
to this application,

37
00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.240
a component that will output an individual user,

38
00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.890
which we can select to view the tasks of that user.

39
00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.760
Now we could, of course, manually create a user folder

40
00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:11.700
and then add all those component files

41
00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.410
and that wouldn't be wrong.

42
00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.290
And indeed, I personally often create

43
00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:17.763
new Components like this.

44
00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.900
But you can also use the Angular CLI

45
00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.760
and run the generate command to generate a new component,

46
00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.830
for example, for this application.

47
00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.750
You can also generate other things,

48
00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.550
but here we need a component,

49
00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:36.423
and you do that by running ng generate component,

50
00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.530
or you can actually shorten this to ng g c

51
00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:47.220
and then the name and path of your component.

52
00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.480
So for example, user, if you wanna create a new user folder

53
00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.183
with the user component files.

54
00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.050
If you then hit Enter,

55
00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:00.750
the Angular CLI will go ahead

56
00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:05.750
and create some files for you in a newly added user folder.

57
00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.450
And of course, we can see that here

58
00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.150
in our project structure.

59
00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:16.710
This user folder was now added by the CLI,

60
00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:21.390
and in there, you find the user.component.html file,

61
00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:23.040
so it's automatically following

62
00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.550
that naming convention I described before,

63
00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:29.160
the user.component.ts file,

64
00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.800
and the user.component.css file,

65
00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:33.273
which is empty at the moment.

66
00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:38.940
You also find a user.component.spec.ts file,

67
00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:41.400
which is used for automated testing,

68
00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.320
and we can delete that right now

69
00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:46.620
since we'll dive into automated tests later in the course,

70
00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.420
not right now.

71
00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:51.270
But with that, we now got the same three files,

72
00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:53.910
which we previously created manually,

73
00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:57.600
now created automatically by the CLI.

74
00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.210
In the user.component.ts file,

75
00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:02.550
you also see that it automatically set up

76
00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:04.470
a fitting selector for us

77
00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:07.350
following that naming convention I described before

78
00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:11.310
and set up the links to the external style files.

79
00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:13.380
It also sets standalone to true

80
00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:16.110
since that's the recommended default nowadays

81
00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:18.030
and added this imports array

82
00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:20.610
in case we would wanna use other Components

83
00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:22.530
inside of that component.

84
00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:25.893
We can delete it if we don't plan on doing that though.
