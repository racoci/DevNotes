00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:02.550
<v Maximilian>Now when working with TypeScript,</v>

2
00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:07.380
it's not just about managing possibly undefined values,

3
00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:09.330
though that is one situation

4
00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.820
where TypeScript can indeed shine.

5
00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.660
But it's also pretty common when working with TypeScript

6
00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.140
that you need to define in advance which type

7
00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.410
of value might be stored somewhere like here

8
00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.650
where we're saying that it's a string or undefined

9
00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.540
because of this question mark.

10
00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:31.812
And you can see the actual type that is in the end assumed

11
00:00:31.812 --> 00:00:34.500
for name by hovering over it and you see that it's a string

12
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:35.943
or undefined

13
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.860
or as we do it in the app component

14
00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.010
where we have this method where we have to tell TypeScript

15
00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.940
that the ID we receive here will be a string

16
00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.483
and just a string, not undefined or anything like that.

17
00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.090
It's pretty common that you must define types like this.

18
00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.780
And thus far we pretty much only worked with strings,

19
00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.460
which is one of the most basic

20
00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.160
and also common types you'll deal with

21
00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:06.993
when working with TypeScript.

22
00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.600
But we could also work

23
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.720
with more complex types if we wanted to.

24
00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.230
Like for example here in the user component.

25
00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:21.090
Here, we have three inputs where we get the user's ID,

26
00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.683
avatar and name.

27
00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.780
And of course if you take a look at the dummy user data,

28
00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.360
you can see that users are in the end only made up

29
00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.490
of these three pieces of data.

30
00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:36.323
So in the end,

31
00:01:36.323 --> 00:01:40.110
we could also simplify the code in the user component

32
00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.890
by instead of accepting three properties here,

33
00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.303
just accepting one property, the entire user object.

34
00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.350
So we could remove this code

35
00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.959
and instead add a single input property,

36
00:01:54.959 --> 00:01:56.913
which could be called user.

37
00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.603
And this should then again, be required.

38
00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:04.800
But now we also have to set the type for that,

39
00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:06.913
and that's now not just a string.

40
00:02:06.913 --> 00:02:11.490
Instead it's now an object with multiple properties

41
00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:13.530
where all those properties

42
00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.833
then also have different types of values.

43
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.370
But that is something you can do in TypeScript.

44
00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:25.170
You can create a so-called object type by using curly braces

45
00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:26.580
just as you would do it

46
00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.370
if you would create an object literal.

47
00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.250
However, here we're not creating a new object,

48
00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.700
but instead we are creating a type here.

49
00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.800
And that's an important difference.

50
00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.620
We're just telling TypeScript which kind

51
00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.920
of value will eventually get here.

52
00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.910
And now you can set up all the properties that you expect

53
00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:51.180
to be in that object type,

54
00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.100
for example, an ID.

55
00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:56.250
But now you also have to tell TypeScript which kind

56
00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.670
of value will be stored in that property.

57
00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.800
And you do that again by adding a colon here

58
00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:04.350
and then the type, so not a value,

59
00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:06.633
but the type in this case, a string.

60
00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.300
Then you can add a semicolon

61
00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:12.300
and define the next property type.

62
00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.910
So for example, that we will have an avatar,

63
00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:16.590
which will also be a string

64
00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:19.113
and a name, which will also be a string,

65
00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.553
and that would now be our user object type.

66
00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:26.250
Now of course we still have

67
00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.920
to add this exclamation mark in addition

68
00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:30.180
to setting up this type

69
00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:33.060
because we still need to convince TypeScript

70
00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.250
that this will definitely be defined

71
00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.953
because of this required true setting.

72
00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:41.100
Now the code of course, must be adjusted.

73
00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:44.400
For example, here, instead of accessing this avatar,

74
00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.160
it's this.user.avatar.

75
00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.073
And down here it's this.user.id.

76
00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:55.710
And in the template of the user component HTML file,

77
00:03:55.710 --> 00:04:00.543
we have to access user.name and also user.name here.

78
00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:06.540
And we now also must adjust the app component template

79
00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.400
because instead of now passing

80
00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:12.030
all these individual properties to app user,

81
00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:15.060
we now just pass the user property

82
00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:18.840
and bind it dynamically to users.

83
00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:22.590
Zero here for the first app user

84
00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:26.643
to users one for the second app user.

85
00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:32.400
And of course then to users two

86
00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:37.320
and to users three down here, and now if I format this,

87
00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:39.603
this all is a bit more readable again.

88
00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:44.133
But that's how you can set up such a object type.
