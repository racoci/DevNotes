00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.160
<v ->[Maximilian Schwarzmuller] Now that we are able</v>

2
00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:05.970
to output the tasks that belong to a user,

3
00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.240
we of course also want to pass that task data

4
00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.430
to that task component

5
00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:14.790
so that in that task component template

6
00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.200
we output the actual task title and time and so on

7
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.960
instead of that dummy data.

8
00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.960
And therefore in that task component TypeScript file here,

9
00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.110
we of course should accept that data

10
00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:34.050
that we want to output as input.

11
00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.470
Hence, I'll import the input decorator

12
00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:40.953
and then add a new input.

13
00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.253
And now we have some options.

14
00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.180
We could add one input per piece of data we want to output.

15
00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.490
So one for the title, one for the time,

16
00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:55.080
and one for the summary.

17
00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:58.530
We could do that, but alternatively

18
00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.530
we could also just accept the entire task object as an input

19
00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.930
and then pull out the pieces of data we need

20
00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.750
inside of this task component.

21
00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.240
And that's what I'll do here.

22
00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.273
So I expect to get a task property,

23
00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.073
but of course now we have to define the type of this task.

24
00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.800
And that type is the type we in the end define here

25
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.410
in the tasks component.

26
00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:31.740
It's this object shape here that we want,

27
00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.130
just translated to a type.

28
00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.810
So what we can do is go back to the task component

29
00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.320
and again, add our own custom object type

30
00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.670
either with the type keyword or with the interface keyword.

31
00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.550
I'll name it task here.

32
00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:55.080
And then every task should have an ID, a user ID, a title,

33
00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:56.700
a summary, and a due date.

34
00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.893
And all the values are strings.

35
00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.260
So here it's ID of type string,

36
00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.690
user ID of type string,

37
00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:08.493
title of type string,

38
00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.730
summary of type string,

39
00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.463
and due date of type string.

40
00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.890
And then we can use this task interface here

41
00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.503
as a type for this input.

42
00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.700
Now we also have to add an exclamation mark

43
00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.360
if we know that we'll always get a task.

44
00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.820
And here I do know that this will be the case

45
00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:37.203
because I will also mark this input as required.

46
00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.660
With that, we can and have to go back

47
00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.140
to the tasks component HTML file,

48
00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:50.880
and now bind this newly added task property

49
00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.760
to such a task object.

50
00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.480
And conveniently, that is of course what we're getting here.

51
00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.130
This task we're getting here

52
00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:03.660
from that selected user tasks list is such a task object,

53
00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:07.953
which we then pass as a value for this task property.

54
00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:11.610
Now of course, in order to see that task content

55
00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:13.980
on the screen, we then also have to go

56
00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.920
to the template of the task component.

57
00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.590
And instead of outputting task title

58
00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:24.210
as a dummy text like this, we can use string interpolation

59
00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:29.210
to output task.title referring to that task property

60
00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.700
we're receiving as an input, which will be of type task,

61
00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.583
and which will therefore have a title property.

62
00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:42.960
And similarly here we can output

63
00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:45.723
the task due date.

64
00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:52.083
And here the task summary like this.

65
00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:57.150
If you save that, you therefore now should see

66
00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:00.210
the actual task data being output

67
00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:02.433
for the users that have tasks.
