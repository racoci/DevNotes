00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:03.239
So now that we understand how this

00:00:03.319 --> 00:00:06.019
content ends up on the screen here, and how this

00:00:06.379 --> 00:00:08.959
app component got loaded unto the screen
therefore,

00:00:09.479 --> 00:00:12.380
it's time to work towards that demo application

00:00:12.439 --> 00:00:14.359
that we wanna build throughout this section.

00:00:14.359 --> 00:00:17.279
And to therefore learn more about Angular and

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.200
all its features. And if we take a

00:00:20.239 --> 00:00:22.919
look at the finished demo application here,

00:00:23.459 --> 00:00:26.420
it's probably fair to say that we could split

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:28.979
this up into multiple components, multiple

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:32.119
UI building blocks. For example, we

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.840
have this header here. We then have this

00:00:35.099 --> 00:00:37.819
sidebar where every element could be

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:40.739
treated as a separate component, a separate

00:00:40.959 --> 00:00:43.899
HTML element. We have this area

00:00:43.939 --> 00:00:46.639
on the right here. If we click on Add

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.619
task, we get this dialogue open up here which

00:00:49.659 --> 00:00:52.159
could also be considered a separate component.

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.099
So in short, we got a bunch of

00:00:55.099 --> 00:00:58.039
building blocks here that make up the overall UI.

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:00.339
And when working with Angular, the

00:01:00.459 --> 00:01:02.979
idea is to build those

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:06.019
building blocks as individual components and to

00:01:06.059 --> 00:01:09.020
then compose them together to get the overall

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.060
UI. And therefore, here, to

00:01:12.079 --> 00:01:14.939
get started with those essentials but also with

00:01:15.059 --> 00:01:17.980
this application, we could get started by building

00:01:18.019 --> 00:01:20.660
this header component here as a first

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.879
step. And the question therefore now, of course,

00:01:23.919 --> 00:01:26.059
is how do we do that?

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:29.139
Well, we already have a component in this

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.839
application, the app component, so the main

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.479
component of this application, the only component

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:36.939
that we have on the screen right now.

00:01:38.279 --> 00:01:41.199
And what we can see here is that this component is
actually

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:44.180
made up of three files that are working together.

00:01:44.779 --> 00:01:47.280
And indeed, that's pretty much the standard in

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:49.880
Angular. You create components as

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:52.679
separate files, and it's typically multiple

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:55.480
files working together that form an overall

00:01:55.579 --> 00:01:58.459
component. So if we wanted to

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:01.179
add a header component for our demo

00:02:01.239 --> 00:02:04.139
application here, we would typically do that by

00:02:04.199 --> 00:02:06.419
adding a new file, a

00:02:06.419 --> 00:02:09.239
header.component.TS file,

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:11.999
for example. And I'm saying for

00:02:12.039 --> 00:02:14.899
example because the exact naming is

00:02:14.919 --> 00:02:17.799
up to you, but this is the common convention

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:20.039
and pattern you'll see in most Angular

00:02:20.119 --> 00:02:22.779
projects. Though with the

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:25.199
release of Angular 20, the

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:27.999
officially recommended or default

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:31.139
file naming pattern has changed, as I

00:02:31.159 --> 00:02:32.939
mentioned in the previous lecture already.

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:36.059
It's now just app.TS or

00:02:36.339 --> 00:02:39.099
header.TS in this case here. So

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:41.759
feel free to use that naming pattern instead.

00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:44.699
But in most projects, you'll see the one I show

00:02:44.719 --> 00:02:47.559
you here in these videos because that has been the

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:50.499
default naming convention since the release of
Angular

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:53.479
2 many years ago. So that's why I

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:56.219
also still use it here. It is what you'll see in
most

00:02:56.299 --> 00:02:58.839
projects out there. But be aware that with Angular

00:02:58.939 --> 00:03:01.899
20, the recommended default

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:04.919
has changed. It is, however, up to you how you
name your

00:03:04.919 --> 00:03:07.659
files, of course. The name you choose, of course,
has no

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:10.419
impact on the code you write or the behavior of

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:13.259
your Angular application. So here, I'll use

00:03:13.339 --> 00:03:16.199
the traditional file naming convention, that

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:19.199
you have a filename that starts with a name

00:03:19.279 --> 00:03:21.899
that identifies the component you're building,

00:03:22.279 --> 00:03:25.219
so a name that describes what the job of

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:27.919
this component will be. It will be a

00:03:27.999 --> 00:03:30.899
header in this case, so that sounds like a fitting
name.

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:34.699
Then you have a dot, and then you describe

00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:37.919
what will be stored in this file. And in this

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:39.679
case, it will be a component, so

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:42.639
it's.component. Later, you will

00:03:42.719 --> 00:03:45.299
learn that in Angular, you can also build

00:03:45.439 --> 00:03:48.419
other things than components, which is why we

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:50.619
have this identifier in the filename.

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:54.799
Well, and then we have this extension.TS

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:57.799
because like all the code we're going to write as

00:03:57.919 --> 00:04:00.639
Angular developers, it will be TypeScript

00:04:00.719 --> 00:04:03.579
code that lives in that file. Though up to

00:04:03.619 --> 00:04:06.059
this point, we haven't really seen any

00:04:06.179 --> 00:04:08.979
TypeScript-specific features except for

00:04:08.999 --> 00:04:11.579
that decorator yet. That will change later.

00:04:11.899 --> 00:04:14.559
But indeed, very often, TypeScript code is

00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:17.399
just JavaScript code because it builds up on

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:19.899
that. So we have this

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:22.819
file, and now in that file, we need

00:04:22.819 --> 00:04:25.399
such a class because components in

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:28.339
Angular are classes that are enhanced by

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:29.979
that component decorator.

00:04:31.039 --> 00:04:33.999
Therefore, in the header component.TS file, we

00:04:34.079 --> 00:04:36.979
should start by exporting a new class, and it

00:04:37.059 --> 00:04:40.019
must be exported so that it can be used in other

00:04:40.099 --> 00:04:42.879
files as well. And the name of that

00:04:42.959 --> 00:04:45.379
class should now be HeaderComponent.

00:04:46.199 --> 00:04:49.099
Again, not for technical reasons. You

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:51.699
could name it whatever you want, but

00:04:51.799 --> 00:04:54.359
again, the convention is that you have a name that

00:04:54.439 --> 00:04:57.059
starts with an identifier of the

00:04:57.199 --> 00:04:59.679
thing you're building, so in this case,

00:04:59.719 --> 00:05:02.179
describing what the component will be about.

00:05:02.339 --> 00:05:05.259
It will be about displaying a header, so that
sounds like a

00:05:05.299 --> 00:05:08.219
fitting name. And then you have a

00:05:08.259 --> 00:05:10.759
description of what the job of this

00:05:10.859 --> 00:05:13.759
class will be. In this case, it will be a class

00:05:13.819 --> 00:05:16.719
that will define a component, but as you will

00:05:16.859 --> 00:05:19.639
also learn later, there also are other

00:05:19.959 --> 00:05:22.859
kinds of classes you can build in Angular that

00:05:22.939 --> 00:05:25.239
will define different things than

00:05:25.319 --> 00:05:27.779
components. But here, it's a

00:05:27.839 --> 00:05:30.639
HeaderComponent, and then you need opening and

00:05:30.699 --> 00:05:33.159
closing curly braces to define the class

00:05:33.279 --> 00:05:36.079
body. And just as for the app

00:05:36.139 --> 00:05:38.399
component, it will stay empty for now.

00:05:38.759 --> 00:05:41.679
That will change later for some of our components,

00:05:41.779 --> 00:05:44.339
but here for this HeaderComponent, it will stay
empty.

00:05:45.759 --> 00:05:48.739
Then in order to convert this to a component, we
need

00:05:48.759 --> 00:05:50.799
to import this component

00:05:50.919 --> 00:05:53.779
decorator from the Angular framework and

00:05:53.799 --> 00:05:56.679
there from the core package. And then

00:05:56.719 --> 00:05:59.439
it must be added by adding this at symbol,

00:05:59.959 --> 00:06:02.859
then the name of the decorator, Component in this

00:06:02.919 --> 00:06:05.419
case, and then by adding parentheses,

00:06:05.599 --> 00:06:06.879
opening and closing.
