00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.260
- Now, before we handle the form

00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:04.880
- submission though, I briefly want to

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:07.080
- show you how you could use two-way

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.760
- binding and this syntax here with

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:12.860
- signals, because at the moment I'm not

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:13.920
- using signals here.

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:17.440
- These are regular properties and we rely

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:19.380
- on the standard angular change

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.340
- detection mechanism for finding out

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:22.960
- whether they changed and for updating

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:23.460
- the UI.

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:27.860
- Now we could be using signals here, by

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:30.540
- calling the signal function, which must

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:34.620
- be imported from atAngularCore, and by

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.000
- then wrapping our initial values with it,

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.320
- so that these values are assigned as

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.380
- initial values for those signals, but they

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:45.540
- can of course now also be changed to

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:46.700
- get updated values.

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:50.120
- Now how can we change them with

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:51.640
- help of two-way binding though?

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.260
- Well, nothing easier than that.

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:56.820
- All you have to do is set up two-way

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.700
- binding as you did it before.

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.080
- So this code here does not need to

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:04.099
- change, because Angular will

00:01:04.099 --> 00:01:07.400
- automatically detect that entered title,

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.480
- entered summary and so on are now

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:13.820
- signals and ngModel will behave

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:17.000
- accordingly and will read those signals

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.700
- internally to get the value that should be

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.740
- set on the input and will update those

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.020
- signals whenever the value changes,

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.680
- because the user types into these input

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:28.060
- fields.

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:31.040
- So you don't need to do anything in a

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.680
- template in order to work with signals

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.160
- instead of those standard properties.

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:39.800
- It's especially important that you don't

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.380
- start reading the signals, though you

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.220
- should get an error if you try to.

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.600
- You should get an error that this is an

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.320
- unsupported expression in a two-way

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:48.740
- binding.

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.840
- Because again, Angular will read those

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.540
- signal values for you when using signals

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:59.000
- in conjunction with two-way binding

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.460
- and ngModel as we're doing it here.

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.160
- With that, I'll get rid of signal here

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:07.860
- though, because I don't want to use

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.360
- signals here and I'll also get rid of the

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.400
- import which was added, but it's of

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:13.760
- course important to know how you

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.040
- could use signals with two-way binding

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:17.060
- and now you do.
