1
00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:02.580
<v Instructor>So we are now using inputs</v>

2
00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.240
to make the user component more reusable,

3
00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.263
but with the current implementation, we'll face a problem.

4
00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.140
I am convincing TypeScript

5
00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:15.360
with help of this exclamation mark here

6
00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.360
that we will definitely receive values for avatar and name

7
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:21.870
and we would get an error

8
00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:24.930
if I were to remove this exclamation mark.

9
00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.580
The problem is, however,

10
00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.610
well technically there is no such guarantee.

11
00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:32.730
Of course, we are always setting the avatar

12
00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:33.870
and name property,

13
00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.810
but let's say for some reason we forget it

14
00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:39.540
on one instance of our component,

15
00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.263
something that could happen when we write our code,

16
00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.190
if I forget it, you see that now, we have a problem here.

17
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.543
The username is of course missing.

18
00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.920
It is of course missing because I forgot it for one user.

19
00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.540
Now of course, this is an error

20
00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:00.120
that's fairly easy to catch and fix

21
00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.860
and that's why we're testing

22
00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:03.660
the applications we're building,

23
00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.060
but it's still an error that actually

24
00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.760
doesn't have to happen like this

25
00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.760
because Angular allows us to configure those input values,

26
00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.350
those input properties.

27
00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.350
We can pass a configuration object to this at input thing.

28
00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:24.090
And then just as with the component

29
00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.210
where we also got various configuration options,

30
00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.433
we have some options we can set here.

31
00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.360
Now, I'll revisit the alias and transform options later,

32
00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.450
but I wanna use the required option right now already.

33
00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.270
Because if you set required to true,

34
00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.953
you are telling Angular that this property must be set,

35
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.630
and that's now in line with what we're telling TypeScript

36
00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.630
that there definitely will be a value.

37
00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.850
Because without required true,

38
00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.000
we're actually telling TypeScript a lie.

39
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.560
We're telling TypeScript

40
00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.530
that there will definitely be a string value

41
00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.253
when that's actually not guaranteed as we see here.

42
00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:12.240
With that required configuration added

43
00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:15.420
and set to true, that changes

44
00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:20.010
because now I'll actually get an error right here in my IDE,

45
00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.540
when I forget to set one of the required properties.

46
00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.180
I get an error that the required input name

47
00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.023
from the component user component must be specified.

48
00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.340
Well and therefore now I can simply re-add it,

49
00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.120
and errors like this are easier to catch and fix.

50
00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.340
We can essentially catch and fix them

51
00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:42.960
during development already,

52
00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:46.800
and we don't have to wait until we test the application.

53
00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.810
That's why this configuration

54
00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.240
and especially this required option,

55
00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:54.243
is a pretty important feature you should be aware of.
