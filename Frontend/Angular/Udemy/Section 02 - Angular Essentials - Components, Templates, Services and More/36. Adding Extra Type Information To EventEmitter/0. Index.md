1
00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.510
<v Maximilian>So you now know how to register outputs</v>

2
00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:06.060
either with the output decorator

3
00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.030
or with help of that output function

4
00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.280
I showed you in the previous lecture.

5
00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:12.600
One thing I wanna note

6
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.960
about this output decorator approach here,

7
00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.410
which I'm using here, is that if you are using it,

8
00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.420
and if you are therefore creating

9
00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.470
that EventEmitter object manually like this,

10
00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.930
you can still actually add

11
00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.930
such a generic type assignment here by adding angle brackets

12
00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:35.910
after EventEmitter, before those parentheses,

13
00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.480
just as we did it earlier with the input function,

14
00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.150
for example, or with the output function

15
00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:43.830
in the last lecture,

16
00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:47.400
to let TypeScript and therefore Angular know

17
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.493
about the type of value you'll be emitting.

18
00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.020
Now, it technically isn't required here.

19
00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.780
I'm not getting an error if I don't add it,

20
00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.670
but this also allows me to emit

21
00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.580
any kind of value without problems.

22
00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:05.013
I could, for example, emit a number here.

23
00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:09.120
That, however, would be problematic

24
00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:12.960
because in my app component where onSelectUser is triggered,

25
00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.120
I'm expecting to get a string value

26
00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.520
and therefore, I might wanna add

27
00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.230
that extra layer of security and make it very clear

28
00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:29.580
that I do plan to emit a string value.

29
00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:34.050
If I then accidentally or one of my colleagues accidentally

30
00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:38.313
emit a number, I get an error here, as you can tell.

31
00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.840
And that's why you might wanna consider

32
00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.720
adding that generic type definition here,

33
00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.570
even if it's technically not required.

34
00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.220
Now, I'm not doing it here,

35
00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.190
but you could add it for extra type safety,

36
00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:55.473
and that's just something to be aware of.
