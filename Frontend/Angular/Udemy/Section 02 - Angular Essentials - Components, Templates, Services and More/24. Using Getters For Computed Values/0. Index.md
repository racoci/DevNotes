00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:02.640
<v Maximilian>So you did now learn</v>

2
00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:06.390
how you can output dynamic data in your templates

3
00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.113
with help of string interpolation and property binding.

4
00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.480
Now, you will fairly often have cases like this

5
00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.990
where you might need to compute

6
00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.850
a value that should be output.

7
00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.370
So where you maybe need to construct a value

8
00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:28.140
like this string here, which consists of multiple values,

9
00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.560
in this case, the avatar property of the selected

10
00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.890
user object and this fixed string.

11
00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.700
And as you can of course, see, you can do this

12
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.923
directly inside of the template.

13
00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.360
However, it is considered a better practice

14
00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.740
to keep your template code, the dynamic template code,

15
00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:54.570
fairly simple and to outsource computations like this

16
00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.490
into a different place.

17
00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:59.880
That's why I will cut this dynamic value

18
00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:03.030
from the user component HTML file.

19
00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.520
And instead I'll use another TypeScript

20
00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:10.170
and JavaScript feature that you can use in classes.

21
00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.050
I'll add a so-called getter.

22
00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:17.310
By adding the get keyword and then any identifier

23
00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.300
of your choice, for example, imagePath,

24
00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.193
though that name is up to you.

25
00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.480
Then you add opening and closing parentheses

26
00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:30.213
and then opening and closing curly braces.

27
00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.680
And this creates a so-called getter.

28
00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.680
It's essentially a method, so a function inside of a class,

29
00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.610
that's usable like a property so that does not need

30
00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.450
to be called and executed explicitly, and that's meant

31
00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.660
to produce and return a new value.

32
00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:55.470
And the new value that should be produced and returned here

33
00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.963
is that path to the image.

34
00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.780
Now here I'm now referring to that selected user property.

35
00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.380
And since I'm now doing this from inside the class,

36
00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.940
instead of from inside the template, as we did it before,

37
00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.940
we must add the this keyword and a dot in front of that.

38
00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.220
Because that's how in JavaScript,

39
00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.540
it's not TypeScript specific, but in JavaScript,

40
00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.840
how you access properties of a class

41
00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.660
from within that same class.

42
00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.050
So with the this keyword, we access this class,

43
00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.660
so to say, to which this getter belongs,

44
00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:40.500
and we can then get hold of the different other properties

45
00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.990
that may be defined in that class,

46
00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:45.423
like this selected user property.

47
00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:49.140
And with that, we now got this image path getter,

48
00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.810
and you can now use that getter just like

49
00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.870
any other property in your template.

50
00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.530
So here as a value for the source property,

51
00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.283
we can now use this image path like this.

52
00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.790
As I mentioned, like a property.

53
00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:09.510
So you don't execute it. You don't add parentheses.

54
00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.150
Even though it's defined like a method here.

55
00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.100
But because it's such a getter,

56
00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.140
because of that get keyword,

57
00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:19.683
you use it like a property, like this.

58
00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:24.660
And with that, you'll get the same result as before.

59
00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:27.543
But now the template is written in a cleaner way.
