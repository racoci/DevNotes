00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:02.640
<v Maximilian>Now, being able to accept inputs</v>

2
00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:07.640
is one important feature and concept in Angular components,

3
00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:10.710
because it allows you to reuse components

4
00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.630
with different data.

5
00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.630
But custom components also often need to emit custom events

6
00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.150
and not just accept inputs.

7
00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.590
So they need to produce outputs as well you could say.

8
00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.990
And that's actually the situation we have

9
00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.180
in our app here as well.

10
00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:32.340
When I click a user,

11
00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.390
I want to soon show the tasks

12
00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.910
for that user here on the right.

13
00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.910
Now of course, that tasks list or whatever it will be,

14
00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.760
will not show up inside of the user component,

15
00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.910
because the user component is really only responsible

16
00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.153
for outputting this user element.

17
00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:59.040
Therefor, the information that a user was clicked

18
00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:02.910
must get out of that user component

19
00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.910
and must be passed on to the app component in this app here,

20
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.700
because it's the app component that's outputting the user

21
00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.030
and it's the app component that could then output

22
00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:20.030
the tasks of that user next to that unordered list

23
00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.443
here for example.

24
00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.740
So we need to let the app component know

25
00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.210
when a user is clicked,

26
00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.480
so when the button in the user component is clicked

27
00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.370
and we already have a click listener

28
00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:33.510
on that button of course,

29
00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:36.720
but now we need to output the information

30
00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.523
that this button was clicked,

31
00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.330
and this can be done with help of another feature

32
00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:46.293
provided by Angular, output properties.
