00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.670
<v Maximilian>Now that we have this newly added</v>

2
00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:05.370
user component and its files here,

3
00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.180
it's time to fill it with some life and content,

4
00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:11.070
and it's also time

5
00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.540
to dive into additional essential Angular features.

6
00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.130
Now, as a first step,

7
00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.130
I wanna start by changing the markup of this user component

8
00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.950
and I wanna change it to have a div,

9
00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:30.153
and inside of that div a button, a standard button.

10
00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.250
In that button, I then wanna have an image of that user

11
00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.820
and we'll set the source attribute soon.

12
00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.610
For the moment, I'll just leave it like this.

13
00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.560
And then next to the image,

14
00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:46.620
a span which will in the future include

15
00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.783
and output the name of the user.

16
00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.150
So that's the general markup I'd like to have here.

17
00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:56.730
Now, in order to make sure that this markup

18
00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.830
and content then also looks good,

19
00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:01.170
we should also set up some stylings here

20
00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.990
and therefore attached you'll find an updated

21
00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:08.990
user.component.css file that includes some CSS styles

22
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.380
you can paste into your user.component.css file

23
00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.090
so that we have some styles

24
00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.063
that make the user Components markup look better.

25
00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.110
Now, the user.component.ts file

26
00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.180
already looks good the way it is.

27
00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.500
We have the selector,

28
00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.350
we have the links to the template and the styles,

29
00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.420
and we have the standalone setting,

30
00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.750
so we don't need to change anything here right now.

31
00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.990
And therefore, as a next step, we can get started

32
00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.970
using that user component

33
00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.390
in the template of some other component.

34
00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.290
And that other component will again be the app component,

35
00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.890
so the root component of our Angular application.

36
00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.900
Here, it's below this header

37
00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:56.253
where I wanna output my app-user component like this.

38
00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.930
But of course, as I explained before,

39
00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.360
it would not work just like that

40
00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.690
because Angular would not know this element.

41
00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:08.190
And indeed, it's telling me

42
00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.900
that it doesn't know the element

43
00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:13.110
right inside my IDE right now.

44
00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.090
Now, the fix is easy.

45
00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.090
As you learned, you need to import the component

46
00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.490
into this app.component.ts file

47
00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:23.670
and then add it to this imports array.

48
00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.620
And we could do this manually here,

49
00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.580
but conveniently, Angular offers me a shortcut

50
00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.220
here in Visual Studio Code.

51
00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.110
If I click on this light bulb here,

52
00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.720
I get some quick fixes suggested,

53
00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.870
or one quick fix in my case actually,

54
00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.460
which is that it will import

55
00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:43.653
and add this user component for me.

56
00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:47.790
So by simply clicking on that, that will be done.

57
00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.190
And as you can see, the import was added

58
00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:54.450
and the UserComponent was added to this imports array.

59
00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.313
So that's now looking good.

60
00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:59.970
With that, we're using the app-user component here,

61
00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:03.210
and now there's just one other little change

62
00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:05.370
or improvement we can make here

63
00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:08.100
and that is that if you have a component

64
00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:09.750
that doesn't have anything

65
00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.450
between its opening and closing tags,

66
00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:15.840
which neither the header nor the user component have,

67
00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.290
and you will learn how you could build Components

68
00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:23.370
that do accept content between their tags later,

69
00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:26.220
but if you have Components that don't have anything

70
00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.640
between their tags, you can simplify this code

71
00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:33.600
and simply write self-closing Components like this

72
00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:37.260
by adding this forward slash at the end of the tag

73
00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.363
and then shortening this code.

74
00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:44.100
Now with that though, if you now save this,

75
00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:47.640
you should see this user component here.

76
00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:50.280
Now of course, the styling is a bit off.

77
00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:53.220
This takes up way too much space

78
00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:56.820
because I just added like this into the app component,

79
00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:59.310
and the app component doesn't restrict

80
00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:01.800
the width of the user component.

81
00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:03.810
And the styles of the user component

82
00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:05.943
have no rules regarding the width.

83
00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:10.020
Therefore, to improve the look of this,

84
00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:13.860
I'll change the markup of the app component template,

85
00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:16.050
and I'll add the main element,

86
00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:18.840
so the standard html main element,

87
00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:21.243
and wrap that about app-user,

88
00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:25.180
and I'll then also add an unordered list

89
00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:30.423
with an id of users for styling purposes.

90
00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:34.620
And in that unordered list, add a list item

91
00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:37.443
and add app-user in that list item.

92
00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:41.280
And now to make sure that this all looks good,

93
00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:44.250
I'll just copy the styles from the attached

94
00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:48.870
app.component.css file into my app.component.css file here,

95
00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:52.140
and I'll overwrite all the existing styles in that component

96
00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:54.243
with the ones from the attached file.

97
00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:58.740
With all that done, if you now go back,

98
00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:01.110
the user component should look better,

99
00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:03.660
but, of course, it's still missing the image

100
00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:06.993
and a proper name, and that's what we'll work on next.
