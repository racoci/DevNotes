WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.430
<v Maximilian>So slowly but steadily</v>

2
00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:04.500
this application is taking shape.

3
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.990
But of course if we select a user,

4
00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.690
we at the moment only see their name

5
00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.390
and that's what we'll change now.

6
00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:16.920
For that, we can go to that tasks component

7
00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:17.910
and in there,

8
00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.000
instead of just outputting their name like this,

9
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.023
I now want to add a bit more markup and content.

10
00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.190
For example, for styling purposes,

11
00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:33.240
I want to add a section with an id of tasks.

12
00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:36.690
And in that section I want to add a header element,

13
00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.420
so the standard built in header element

14
00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.573
and move this h2 element into this header.

15
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.370
And I also don't just wanna output the name of the user,

16
00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.810
but instead name then single quote s Tasks

17
00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:56.883
so that this will say Emily's tasks and so on.

18
00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:01.500
Now below this h2 element,

19
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.010
I'll add a menu which contains one button,

20
00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.370
which will later allow us to add a new task.

21
00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:11.223
Hence it has a caption of Add Task.

22
00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.220
Later we'll add a click listener

23
00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.900
and do something when it's clicked.

24
00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.000
But for now we'll just leave it like this.

25
00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.680
And then below this header, the idea is

26
00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.940
to output an unordered list of tasks,

27
00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:30.840
so of the tasks that have been assigned to a user.

28
00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.370
And for that we'll soon build a dedicated custom component

29
00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:39.423
which will be output as a list item in that list.

30
00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:43.170
That's the idea here.

31
00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.890
Now with that change made, if we select a user,

32
00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.883
this looks like this, which is not too great.

33
00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.260
The reason for that is that we currently got no styles

34
00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:56.760
for this component yet,

35
00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:58.800
and that's why attached you find

36
00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.790
a prepared tasks.component.css file,

37
00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.973
which does include some styles for this component.

38
00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.530
Now we already are linking to that file

39
00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.830
here in the tasks component TypeScript file,

40
00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.520
and therefore those styles will be included.

41
00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.493
And if you reload, this now looks much better.

42
00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.270
So that's the first step.

43
00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:28.140
The next step now is to output some tasks

44
00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:29.613
for our users here.

45
00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.690
Now in order to output multiple tasks here,

46
00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.530
I wanna create a new reusable task component.

47
00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.473
So a component that outputs an individual task.

48
00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.480
And we can do this with help of the Angular CLI again,

49
00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.200
and you can of course absolutely also try this on your own

50
00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.720
first as a little exercise

51
00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.840
that you create a new task component

52
00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.930
and you then output a list of such tasks

53
00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.843
inside of this tasks component here.

54
00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:06.450
The task component, so the component for an individual task,

55
00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.213
can simply output some dummy data for now.

56
00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.870
I'll create this new component now

57
00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:17.223
by again using the Angular CLI to generate a new component.

58
00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:19.230
And I want

59
00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:23.400
to generate this new component in the tasks folder.

60
00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.010
And this is how you can do this with the CLI.

61
00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:29.860
You define the path to the component that should be added

62
00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.800
tasks/ and then the name of the new component,

63
00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.453
task in this case.

64
00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:40.200
Again, I need no automated tests,

65
00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:44.070
so I'll add --skip-tests.

66
00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:45.480
And with that,

67
00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.780
this task folder here is created.

68
00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:52.832
In there for the moment we can simply output a task

69
00:03:52.832 --> 00:03:55.080
or something like this.

70
00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:58.020
And then in the tasks.component.html file,

71
00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:00.600
we can use that here in the list.

72
00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:04.023
Use the newly added app-task component.

73
00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:07.740
Of course, as always, in order to use it here,

74
00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:10.020
it must first be unlocked

75
00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:14.260
so we can auto import it into the tasks component

76
00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:17.553
so that it's added to imports there.

77
00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:21.960
And with that done it will be output here.

78
00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:25.290
And now we could output multiple tasks here like this.

79
00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:27.900
We can't use @for yet

80
00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:31.140
because we don't really have any list data

81
00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:33.900
that would allow us to output multiple tasks.

82
00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:34.950
That will change soon,

83
00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:38.430
but for the moment we can simply output it like this.

84
00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:41.400
With that, if you reload,

85
00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.563
you will see some tasks here.

86
00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:48.300
Now I wanna improve the styling

87
00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:52.650
and also the markup of this task component here,

88
00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:57.650
and therefore attached you find a task.component.css file,

89
00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:01.020
which contains some styles you should place

90
00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:04.023
in your task.component.css file.

91
00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:08.910
And back in the task component template file,

92
00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:12.030
so in this task.component.html file,

93
00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:13.840
I will now add an article

94
00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:17.880
and in there have my h2 element,

95
00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:21.840
which will later output the task title,

96
00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:25.113
once we have some dynamic task data.

97
00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:30.420
Then below that some time

98
00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:32.820
which will also be added in the future.

99
00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:35.940
Then a summary of the task

100
00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:39.930
and then another paragraph with a class

101
00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:43.090
of actions where I wanna have a button

102
00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:47.730
that will allow me to mark a task as completed.

103
00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:51.093
Again, we'll add some real data later, of course.

104
00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:56.520
With that done, if we now select a user,

105
00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:59.190
we see these task items here,

106
00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:02.283
which arguably look better than what we had before.

107
00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:05.640
But of course now it would be nice

108
00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:07.830
to have some real task data

109
00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:09.330
that would be output here

110
00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:12.453
instead of having this dummy fallback content.
