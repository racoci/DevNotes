## Attribute Binding 
In the previous lecture, you were introduced to **"Property Binding"** \- a key Angular feature that allows you to bind element properties to dynamic values.

For example, `<img [src]="someSrc">` binds the `src` property of the underlying [HTMLImageElement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLImageElement) DOM object to the value stored in `someSrc`.

Whilst it might look like you're binding the src attribute of the `<img>` tag, you're actually NOT doing that. Instead, property binding really targets the underlying DOM object property (in this case a property that's also called `src`) and binds that.

This might look like a subtle detail (and often it indeed doesn't matter) but it's important to understand this difference between element attributes and property. [This article](https://jakearchibald.com/2024/attributes-vs-properties/) can help with understanding this difference.

Whilst it won't make a difference in Angular apps in many cases, it DOES matter if you're trying to set attributes on elements dynamically. Attributes which don't have an equally-named underlying property.

For example, when binding [ARIA attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA), you can't target an underlying DOM object property.

Since "Property Binding" wants to target properties (and not attributes), that can be a problem. That's why Angular offers a slight variation of the "Property Binding" syntax that does allow you to bind attributes to dynamic values.

It looks like this:

```html
<div
 role="progressbar"
 [attr.aria-valuenow]="currentVal"
 [attr.aria-valuemax]="maxVal">...</div>
```

* 

By adding `attr` in front of the attribute name you want to bind dynamically, you're *"telling"* Angular that it shouldn't try to find a property with the specified name but instead bind the respective attribute \- in the example above, the `aria-valuenow` and `aria-valuemax` attributes would be bound dynamically.
