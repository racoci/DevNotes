00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.000
So let's now build this
application together

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.766
and let's solve this exercise together.

00:00:06.766 --> 00:00:10.300
By the way, if you were not
able to do this on your own,

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:11.666
that's no problem.

00:00:11.666 --> 00:00:13.400
We're just getting started.

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.766
It's the second application
you're building.

00:00:15.766 --> 00:00:17.533
It's totally normal if you're not able

00:00:17.533 --> 00:00:20.033
to complete it on your own yet.

00:00:20.033 --> 00:00:23.533
You'll get more practice
throughout the rest of this course

00:00:23.533 --> 00:00:24.900
and you'll get plenty

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.333
of useful knowledge out of this section.

00:00:27.333 --> 00:00:30.066
Let's simply build it together now.

00:00:30.066 --> 00:00:34.466
And I wanna start with
that first task here.

00:00:34.466 --> 00:00:38.333
I wanna add that "Header"
component to my application.

00:00:39.366 --> 00:00:41.533
And therefore in the app folder,

00:00:41.533 --> 00:00:43.800
we can add a new header folder,

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.533
where we can add those component files.

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.933
Or alternatively, we don't do that.

00:00:50.933 --> 00:00:53.366
And instead, in a new terminal window,

00:00:53.366 --> 00:00:57.966
we use the Angular CLI to
add that header component.

00:00:57.966 --> 00:01:01.433
With the ng, g, c command

00:01:01.433 --> 00:01:04.633
to generate a new component,

00:01:04.633 --> 00:01:06.400
and I'll name that component header

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.666
and I'll add the dash,
dash, skip dash, tests flag

00:01:10.666 --> 00:01:14.066
so that this extra testing
file isn't generated,

00:01:14.066 --> 00:01:15.766
because I don't need that.

00:01:17.433 --> 00:01:20.200
With that, I got my header folder here

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.266
with the header.component files,

00:01:22.266 --> 00:01:24.233
and it automatically created

00:01:24.233 --> 00:01:26.333
a standalone component for me here.

00:01:26.333 --> 00:01:29.466
And I'll start by using
standalone components,

00:01:29.466 --> 00:01:31.933
but later at the end of this section,

00:01:31.933 --> 00:01:35.566
I'll migrated all to
module based components

00:01:35.566 --> 00:01:39.166
so that you also see how you
could use modules instead

00:01:39.166 --> 00:01:41.000
of standalone components.

00:01:42.066 --> 00:01:44.600
Now I will actually not change anything

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.533
in that header ts file though,

00:01:46.533 --> 00:01:50.066
instead, I'll jump to the
header.component.html file,

00:01:50.066 --> 00:01:51.266
because it's in there

00:01:51.266 --> 00:01:56.266
where I now wanna add the
header element like this.

00:01:57.666 --> 00:02:00.166
And then in there, I
wanna have an h1 element,

00:02:00.166 --> 00:02:04.533
where I say, Investment Calculator.

00:02:04.533 --> 00:02:07.733
And above that, I wanna
have an image like this.

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:09.966
And here for this source,

00:02:09.966 --> 00:02:12.333
it's now important to recognize

00:02:12.333 --> 00:02:16.133
that the image is actually
now in the public folder.

00:02:16.133 --> 00:02:19.766
It's this
investment-calculator-logo.png file,

00:02:19.766 --> 00:02:21.766
and you can actually just add it like this

00:02:21.766 --> 00:02:25.800
and add the extension
without adding public slash

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:26.800
at the beginning.

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.000
And also not by adding assets
slash at the beginning,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.100
because it isn't in an assets folder.

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.666
And whilst it is in a public folder,

00:02:34.666 --> 00:02:37.066
this folder and the files inside of it

00:02:37.066 --> 00:02:39.533
are actually loaded slightly differently

00:02:39.533 --> 00:02:43.300
so that you can and should
omit the public path here

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.800
and just directly reference the files

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:48.666
and folders inside of the public folder.

00:02:48.666 --> 00:02:49.766
So in this case,

00:02:49.766 --> 00:02:53.300
the image that's stored
inside of the public folder.

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:55.800
And then we should also
add some alt text here,

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:56.633
like,

00:02:57.966 --> 00:02:59.100
money bag,

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:02.133
because that's in the end
what's visible on this image.

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.100
So that's the markup.

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:07.200
We also need some styling,

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.033
and that's why I attached

00:03:09.033 --> 00:03:12.633
some components style files
earlier in this section.

00:03:12.633 --> 00:03:16.900
But attached U again finds
the header.component.css file,

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:20.800
and you can simply replace
your header.component.css file

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:22.400
with the attached one.

00:03:24.633 --> 00:03:25.833
Well, and with that,

00:03:25.833 --> 00:03:26.766
we got the markup,

00:03:26.766 --> 00:03:27.933
we got the styles,

00:03:27.933 --> 00:03:31.166
and we don't need any
special TypeScript logic.

00:03:31.166 --> 00:03:32.366
And we can, therefore,

00:03:32.366 --> 00:03:36.166
go back to the app.component.html file.

00:03:36.166 --> 00:03:39.766
And in there, you can now
replace this h1 element

00:03:39.766 --> 00:03:42.866
with app-header,

00:03:42.866 --> 00:03:46.100
and you can add that as a
self-closing tag like this,

00:03:47.133 --> 00:03:48.366
though, as you see,

00:03:48.366 --> 00:03:49.633
this will give us an error

00:03:49.633 --> 00:03:51.366
that it's not a known element.

00:03:51.366 --> 00:03:53.666
Because by default, as you learned,

00:03:53.666 --> 00:03:58.666
Angular doesn't scan your
project for possible components.

00:03:58.933 --> 00:04:02.966
So in order to make Angular
aware of a component here,

00:04:02.966 --> 00:04:05.533
you have to add it to this imports array

00:04:05.533 --> 00:04:08.333
in the AppComponent TypeScript file.

00:04:08.333 --> 00:04:10.966
So here, I'll add this imports array

00:04:10.966 --> 00:04:14.533
in my AppComponent component selector,

00:04:14.533 --> 00:04:19.233
and I will import the HeaderComponent

00:04:20.266 --> 00:04:25.266
from ./header/header.component,

00:04:25.833 --> 00:04:28.366
and then also add it here to imports.

00:04:29.766 --> 00:04:32.566
Alternatively, if I remove that,

00:04:32.566 --> 00:04:36.600
we could, of course, also
have used our IDE support

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:38.966
and we could have chosen
that Quick Fix here,

00:04:38.966 --> 00:04:41.666
which Visual Studio Code suggested to me.

00:04:42.866 --> 00:04:46.000
This also adds this import

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.633
and adds it here to this imports array.

00:04:50.033 --> 00:04:53.766
And with that, if you go
back to local host 4,200,

00:04:53.766 --> 00:04:57.100
you should now see your
header here on the screen,

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:59.533
the title and the image.

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:04.100
And that's the first
step completed already,

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:06.200
though, of course, arguably,

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:08.833
the remaining steps
will take up more time.
