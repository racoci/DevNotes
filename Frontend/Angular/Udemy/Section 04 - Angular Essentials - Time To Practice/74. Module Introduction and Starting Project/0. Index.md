1
00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:02.850
<v Maximilian>Only practice makes perfect.</v>

2
00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.690
And that's of course also the case for Angular.

3
00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:08.850
That's why in this section here

4
00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:12.600
we'll build another brand new demo project.

5
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.630
An Investment Calculator where users

6
00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.170
can enter their initial investment amount,

7
00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.110
then their expected annual investment rate,

8
00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:25.380
their expected return and the duration.

9
00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.030
And then as a result,

10
00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:30.480
see how their investment is expected to develop.

11
00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.830
But of course, this section is not primarily about this app,

12
00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:36.630
even though it's a nice demo app.

13
00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.270
But instead it's about a applying the knowledge

14
00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.690
you gained thus far and about practicing what you learned.

15
00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.710
It's about practicing all those Angular Essentials.

16
00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.835
And therefore this section now is a nice exercise

17
00:00:49.835 --> 00:00:53.790
where we will build this Investment Calculator

18
00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:55.440
by adding a "Header" component

19
00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.480
with a title and an image,

20
00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.400
by adding a "User Input" component

21
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.820
that collects user input with two-way-binding.

22
00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.000
And by adding an "InvestmentResults" component

23
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.970
that will output the results in a table.

24
00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.964
And you can definitely try building this application

25
00:01:11.964 --> 00:01:15.908
on your own first, before then following along with me

26
00:01:15.908 --> 00:01:19.530
over the next lectures where we will build this together.

27
00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.122
You can try this on your own first,

28
00:01:21.122 --> 00:01:23.460
and you can use signals or not.

29
00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.200
You can use Standalone Components

30
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.120
or Module-based Components.

31
00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:31.530
I will show you all different approaches in this section.

32
00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.480
You can use a service or not.

33
00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:37.296
You can solve this exercise in any way you want,

34
00:01:37.296 --> 00:01:39.990
but of course, it will be challenging.

35
00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.820
So if you're not able to solve it,

36
00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.740
that's also absolutely fine.

37
00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.540
We're just getting started here,

38
00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.210
and you can simply take this section

39
00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.140
as an extra opportunity to follow along with my solution

40
00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.120
and follow my explanations.

41
00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:56.431
And you can also always pause my explanations

42
00:01:56.431 --> 00:02:00.630
and only try out the next steps on your own.

43
00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.910
If you wanna tackle the entire exercise,

44
00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:04.290
that's of course great,

45
00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.050
but you should then also absolutely have a look

46
00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:10.160
at the next lecture first since that lecture

47
00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.690
will include some helpful hints

48
00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.940
that you should absolutely keep in mind.

49
00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:16.686
Now, attached to this lecture,

50
00:02:16.686 --> 00:02:19.561
you find a brand new starting project,

51
00:02:19.561 --> 00:02:23.196
which you should use since in there I, for example,

52
00:02:23.196 --> 00:02:27.840
prepared this investment-results typeScript file,

53
00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.149
which you most likely won't use like that,

54
00:02:30.149 --> 00:02:32.405
but which contains some code

55
00:02:32.405 --> 00:02:35.730
that you might need to tweak a bit.

56
00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.920
As you see right now, it got some errors,

57
00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.980
but which you could use as a starting point

58
00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:45.980
to use that user input and derive those annual results.

59
00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:49.350
The data that should be output in a table

60
00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.030
You don't have to use that file,

61
00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.980
but I will use it in my solution,

62
00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:57.980
and it is simply there to help you focus on the Angular part

63
00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:01.890
so that don't need to figure out how you can calculate

64
00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:04.764
the accumulated interest and so on,

65
00:03:04.764 --> 00:03:08.010
because that's not what this exercise is about.

66
00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.610
It is of course about the Angular part.

67
00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:13.140
So that's the starting project,

68
00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.450
and I got two important notes

69
00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:17.430
regarding that starting project.

70
00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:21.180
For one, you'll notice that it has a public folder

71
00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:24.540
and no SRC assets folder.

72
00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.910
It's that public folder that contains the image

73
00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:30.300
that must be used in the header, for example.

74
00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:31.830
And if you wanna use that image,

75
00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:33.289
there's one important difference

76
00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:37.740
compared to how you loaded it from the assets folder.

77
00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:40.140
If you wanna use an image from the public folder,

78
00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:42.908
you don't put "public" into your image path.

79
00:03:42.908 --> 00:03:46.710
Instead, you immediately put your image file name here,

80
00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:48.483
whatever that file name may be.

81
00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.060
And that will then load it.

82
00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.347
So, files stored in that public folder

83
00:03:53.347 --> 00:03:57.540
are referenced like this without adding public/

84
00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:58.373
in front of them.

85
00:03:58.373 --> 00:04:00.090
That's one important hint.

86
00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:02.340
One important thing to be aware of.

87
00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:03.173
Other than that,

88
00:04:03.173 --> 00:04:06.420
you can load and include the image as you learned it.

89
00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:07.581
The other important thing

90
00:04:07.581 --> 00:04:11.490
if you are trying to solve this exercise on your own

91
00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:14.910
is that you'll need to build a couple of Components.

92
00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:17.484
And in order to save you the hassle

93
00:04:17.484 --> 00:04:22.320
of writing your own style files, attached to this lecture,

94
00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:27.320
you actually find those prepared Components style files,

95
00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:29.580
which you can use for your component

96
00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:32.703
so that you don't have to write the CSS code on your own.

97
00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:36.096
Of course, you then also may wanna have a look

98
00:04:36.096 --> 00:04:40.800
at this CSS code to see which classes and elements

99
00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.816
are used there to structure

100
00:04:42.816 --> 00:04:45.390
your component markup accordingly.

101
00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:47.828
Though ultimately, it's of course not too important

102
00:04:47.828 --> 00:04:51.090
that you get the styling right, you should just try

103
00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:55.380
to build some Investment Calculator application.

104
00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:57.000
So, that's the starting project.

105
00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.540
In order to use it, you should run npm install

106
00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:03.180
in that attached folder once you downloaded it

107
00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:06.210
so that you install all dependencies.

108
00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:07.890
And then, with that out of the way,

109
00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:10.980
npm start to start the development server.

110
00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:13.980
Now, you can try building this application on your own

111
00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:17.463
starting with the next lecture we'll build it together.
