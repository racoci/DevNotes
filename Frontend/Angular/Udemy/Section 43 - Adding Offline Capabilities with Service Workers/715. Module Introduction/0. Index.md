00:02.250 --> 00:04.320
-: Hi, everyone. Welcome to this video.

00:04.320 --> 00:09.150
In this video, we'll turn a online-only Angular application

00:09.150 --> 00:13.740
into a offline-available one by adding a service worker.

00:13.740 --> 00:16.620
And, as you will see, this is super easy to do with Angular.

00:16.620 --> 00:18.540
And I will show you how to turn it

00:18.540 --> 00:20.040
into a session application,

00:20.040 --> 00:21.780
and how you can then also configure it

00:21.780 --> 00:23.670
to fully meet your needs.

00:23.670 --> 00:25.720
So let's dive in.

00:25.720 --> 00:28.650
(paper unraveling)

00:28.650 --> 00:30.510
-: We'll start with this very simple

00:30.510 --> 00:33.420
Angular application here, and you can find the code

00:33.420 --> 00:36.115
to that project attached to this video.

00:36.115 --> 00:38.850
And this is obviously a very, while simple,

00:38.850 --> 00:40.652
not too exciting Angular app.

00:40.652 --> 00:45.640
It is rendering a list of blog posts, dummy blog posts,

00:45.640 --> 00:48.990
which are fetched in our app component here

00:48.990 --> 00:50.610
from "jsonplaceholder".

00:50.610 --> 00:54.270
Well, that is just a page exposing a dummy REST API

00:54.270 --> 00:56.970
which you can use to get some demo data

00:56.970 --> 00:58.560
to display on your page.

00:58.560 --> 01:01.533
You can also send dummy POST requests to them and so on.

01:01.533 --> 01:05.130
But that's not what we'll do. We'll focus on getting data.

01:05.130 --> 01:09.116
So this is a normal Angular app, not too many features,

01:09.116 --> 01:12.090
but it represents a typical Angular app.

01:12.090 --> 01:16.140
We got more than one component and we also got our posts.

01:16.140 --> 01:17.850
And if you watch closely, you'll see

01:17.850 --> 01:19.740
I'm also using some special font,

01:19.740 --> 01:22.680
which I'm actually pulling in in my index HTML file.

01:22.680 --> 01:26.430
Here I'm importing this "Oswald" font here

01:26.430 --> 01:28.440
from Google Fonts.

01:28.440 --> 01:31.050
So this is what makes up our Angular app.

01:31.050 --> 01:34.304
Now if we inspect it in Chrome, we can go to the

01:34.304 --> 01:37.440
Application tab here in the Developer Tools.

01:37.440 --> 01:40.680
And we can turn this to Offline mode, which means we're

01:40.680 --> 01:44.632
still online, we don't have to quit our Wi-Fi network.

01:44.632 --> 01:48.090
But this will simulate that we got no internet connection.

01:48.090 --> 01:51.900
And if I now reload the page, well obviously I get an error

01:51.900 --> 01:54.330
that we don't have an internet connection.

01:54.330 --> 01:57.150
If I go back online, it works again.

01:57.150 --> 01:59.730
Now let's see how we can actually "fix this",

01:59.730 --> 02:03.300
or change this behavior, with the help of a service worker

02:03.300 --> 02:06.390
and how we can easily add such a service worker to the app

02:06.390 --> 02:07.383
with Angular.
