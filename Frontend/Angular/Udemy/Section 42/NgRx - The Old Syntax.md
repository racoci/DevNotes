Originally, this section was recorded based on an **older version of NgRx**. This version required more verbose code and is not recommended anymore.

But if you find yourself working on a project that uses an older version of NgRx OR if you want to see NgRx applied to the "Recipe Book" course project, you might find that old content interesting.

I had to unpublish the lectures to make room for new course content, that's why **attached to this lecture** you find ZIP files that contain the old videos and attachments. So, if you're interested in that old content, you can download those ZIP files to watch those old videos.

The old videos start with video 4, since the first three videos simply explained what NgRx is - something you already know by now :).

  

**Some things to keep in mind:**

**1)** We'll install NgRx via `npm install --save @ngrx/store` => You could use `ng add @ngrx/store` instead (as shown in the previous lectures)

**2)** We'll use the **"old" actions, reducers & effects syntax** (i.e., without `createAction()`, `createReducer()` and `createEffect()`)

=> With the exception of the old effects syntax (which uses `@Effect()`, which is not supported anymore), you **can stick to that syntax**. Alternatively, you can switch to the approach you learned about in the previous lectures.

As mentioned, you'll find **multiple code snapshot attachments** in the attached ZIP File - snapshots with the "old" and "new" syntax. This should make following along easy & straightforward.
