00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.120
<v Maximilian>Now when building web applications</v>

2
00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:05.940
and their user interfaces,

3
00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.180
outputting dynamic data is just one thing

4
00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:11.070
you often need to do.

5
00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.180
You also often need to listen to user input

6
00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:17.430
so that you can then, for example,

7
00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.363
also update the UI upon certain kinds of input.

8
00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:24.840
And that's, therefore, what we'll do next,

9
00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.050
listen to user input and then in a second step,

10
00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.490
also change the UI after some user input.

11
00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:34.860
And conveniently, we have this button here.

12
00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.510
So let's say for a start, we'd like to add an event listener

13
00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.720
to that button to listen for click events

14
00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:44.520
so that we then, for the moment,

15
00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.430
simply output something in the console.

16
00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.330
And in Angular where you write declarative code,

17
00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:53.910
you add event listeners to elements

18
00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.420
by going to those elements in your templates.

19
00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.940
So by going to this button, for example,

20
00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.670
and by then specifying the name of the event

21
00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:03.720
you wanna listen to.

22
00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:05.910
So for example, click.

23
00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:10.140
You then wrap this event name with parentheses,

24
00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.890
regular parentheses, opening and closing.

25
00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.140
So event name between parentheses.

26
00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.300
That's Angular's syntax

27
00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.940
for adding an event listener to an element,

28
00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:23.313
to this button here, in this case.

29
00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.700
Now as mentioned, you could add a broad variety

30
00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:27.810
of event listeners,

31
00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.080
and if you add an empty pair of parentheses

32
00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.480
and you place your cursor between them

33
00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:35.940
and you press Control + Space,

34
00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:38.640
most IDEs should give you a list

35
00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.743
of event listeners you could add.

36
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.680
So here you see the click event,

37
00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.390
but also a bunch of other events

38
00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.060
you could possibly also wanna listen to.

39
00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.310
In my case here, it's the click event though.

40
00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.370
Well, and then you should add an equal sign.

41
00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:56.730
And then between those quotes, you add the code

42
00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:00.240
that should be executed when that event occurs.

43
00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.600
Though typically, you don't add it here in the template,

44
00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.240
but instead inside of some method

45
00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.050
that you define on your component class.

46
00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.670
And that's what I'll do here.

47
00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.940
In that user component class, I'll add a new method,

48
00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.200
and I'll name it onSelectUser,

49
00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.150
though the name is up to you.

50
00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.690
It's just one common pattern that you'll see quite a bit

51
00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.410
that those functions, those methods

52
00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:31.110
that are meant to be executed upon some event

53
00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.500
start with on as a prefix to make it clear

54
00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.680
that they're meant to be executed upon some event.

55
00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.830
But it's not a hard rule you have to follow,

56
00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:42.780
and you'll see different conventions

57
00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.630
in different Angular projects.

58
00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:48.570
Then you add parentheses and curly braces.

59
00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:51.930
And with that, you got a regular method as you could add it

60
00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:56.010
to any class when using TypeScript or JavaScript.

61
00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:57.690
And here for the moment, I'll then simply

62
00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.037
console.log('Clicked'),

63
00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.523
just so that we can see that it worked.

64
00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.030
Now to connect this to the click event,

65
00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.090
you should use that name of that method,

66
00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:13.680
and then use that as a value for this click event listener

67
00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.553
and add parentheses after it as if you would be calling it.

68
00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.200
It will, however, be called for you when that click occurs,

69
00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.660
not when this line of code is parsed,

70
00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:27.120
but instead, only once I click

71
00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:28.953
on that button element occurred.

72
00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:34.860
Well, and with that, if you now save that and you go back

73
00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:37.290
and you open your developer tools,

74
00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:39.660
and there your JavaScript Console

75
00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:42.150
so that you can see log messages.

76
00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:46.263
If you click that element, you should see clicked here.

77
00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.680
And you will see a new output,

78
00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.590
as you can tell by this number here, which is changing,

79
00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:54.783
every time I'm clicking this button.

80
00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:58.980
And that's how you can listen to events in Angular

81
00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:02.010
and how you can define which code should execute

82
00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:03.033
when they occur.
