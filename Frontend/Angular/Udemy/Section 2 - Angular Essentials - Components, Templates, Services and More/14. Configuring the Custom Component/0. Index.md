00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:02.100
- Then between those parentheses,

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.500
we pass a configuration object

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.166
just as we saw it on this app Component.

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.000
And now here for our
first custom Component,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.066
the header Component, we again
have to define a selector

00:00:16.066 --> 00:00:19.433
that will tell Angular
which elements on the screen

00:00:19.433 --> 00:00:22.200
should be controlled by our own Component

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.866
or should be replaced by our
own Component, you could say.

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:31.166
And here the convention is
to select elements by tag

00:00:31.166 --> 00:00:34.666
and to select elements
by a tag that consists

00:00:34.666 --> 00:00:39.333
of at least two words separated by a dash.

00:00:39.333 --> 00:00:42.000
For example, app-header.

00:00:42.966 --> 00:00:44.166
The reason for that is

00:00:44.166 --> 00:00:46.566
that if you would choose just one word,

00:00:46.566 --> 00:00:49.833
you could clash with built-in elements.

00:00:49.833 --> 00:00:54.833
For example, there is a
built-in header element in HTML.

00:00:54.866 --> 00:00:56.766
And with that kind of Component,

00:00:56.766 --> 00:00:59.133
we would be overriding the default header

00:00:59.133 --> 00:01:01.666
with our own custom
Component all the time,

00:01:01.666 --> 00:01:04.200
and that's probably not what we want,

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:07.166
hence it should be app dash header.

00:01:07.166 --> 00:01:11.033
Now this prefix here is up to
you app is a common choice,

00:01:11.033 --> 00:01:13.800
but it could be my app,
it could be your name,

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.466
whatever you want, I'll go for app.

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.500
And with that we have a
selector that selects elements

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.000
that should be replaced
by our header Component.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.233
Then as I always explained before,

00:01:26.233 --> 00:01:30.666
you also always need a template
which defines the markup,

00:01:30.666 --> 00:01:34.633
the content that should be
displayed by that Component.

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.500
Now, you could set up a template

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.266
by adding a template property like this,

00:01:40.266 --> 00:01:43.500
and then you could set up
the template as a string

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.266
right inside of this components.
typescript file like this,

00:01:51.366 --> 00:01:52.433
that would work,

00:01:52.433 --> 00:01:55.733
but this is actually not a recommended way

00:01:55.733 --> 00:01:57.433
of defining a template.

00:01:57.433 --> 00:02:00.766
You should only use this inline approach

00:02:00.766 --> 00:02:03.600
where you do it inside
of this TypeScript file.

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.533
If you have super simple short templates

00:02:06.533 --> 00:02:08.366
that only consist of one or two

00:02:08.366 --> 00:02:10.266
or maybe three lines of code,

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.666
if you have more complex
templates or simply in general,

00:02:15.666 --> 00:02:19.833
it is recommended that you
use an external HTML file

00:02:19.833 --> 00:02:24.233
at which you point with help
of the template URL property

00:02:24.233 --> 00:02:26.200
in that configuration object.

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.200
And then this wants a string

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.700
that contains the relative
path seen relative

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.666
from this TypeScript file

00:02:34.666 --> 00:02:38.366
to the file that contains the
markup for this Component.

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.966
At the moment, I don't
have such a file yet,

00:02:41.966 --> 00:02:44.266
but we can of course add one.

00:02:44.266 --> 00:02:46.833
And again, the convention
is to basically repeat

00:02:46.833 --> 00:02:51.300
the name of the TypeScript
file, so header.component,

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:53.466
but now since it will contain markup,

00:02:53.466 --> 00:02:55.766
it should end with .html.

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.700
And now you would link to that file from

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.233
inside the TypeScript file

00:03:01.233 --> 00:03:03.800
by defining that relative path,

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.333
which in this case since
they're in the same folder,

00:03:06.333 --> 00:03:09.466
means that the path is
.slash to make it clear

00:03:09.466 --> 00:03:10.766
that it's a relative path,

00:03:10.766 --> 00:03:15.300
and then just the file
name, header.component.html.

00:03:17.233 --> 00:03:19.433
With that, we can then put our markup

00:03:19.433 --> 00:03:24.000
into this external HTML file,
and here I'll for example,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.833
use the standard header element,

00:03:25.833 --> 00:03:28.933
so that's the one built into the browser.

00:03:28.933 --> 00:03:32.533
It's not my custom Component
or anything like that.

00:03:32.533 --> 00:03:35.100
And then I'll just add a H one tag for now

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:37.100
with a text of easy task.

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:39.800
That could be the name of
the demo app we're building.

00:03:40.666 --> 00:03:44.500
We'll add more content to this
markup later for the moment

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.033
that's all I want here.

00:03:47.666 --> 00:03:50.500
Now with that, our
Component is almost done,

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.800
but we can add more.

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:56.066
For example some styles
though I'll get back to that

00:03:56.066 --> 00:03:57.666
in a second.

00:03:57.666 --> 00:04:00.400
What we should add
right now already though

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:04.066
is another important
configuration property,

00:04:04.066 --> 00:04:06.000
and that's the standalone property

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.633
which should be set to true.

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:12.233
Though I will say that depending on the Angular version

00:04:12.233 --> 00:04:16.066
you're using, this might be set to true automatically.

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.233
To be precise, if you're working in a project

00:04:19.233 --> 00:04:22.733
that uses Angular 19 or higher,

00:04:23.366 --> 00:04:25.666
this will be true by default

00:04:25.666 --> 00:04:28.600
and you therefore don't need to set this property.

00:04:28.833 --> 00:04:29.566
You can omit it.

00:04:29.933 --> 00:04:32.966
And you should check your package.json file

00:04:32.966 --> 00:04:35.933
to find out which Angular version you're using

00:04:35.933 --> 00:04:37.100
in your project.

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:41.466
Now, if you're using a version lower than 19,

00:04:41.766 --> 00:04:44.066
you must set this to true

00:04:44.066 --> 00:04:46.133
because false would be the default there

00:04:46.133 --> 00:04:47.500
and we don't want that.

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:49.900
We want that to be true.

00:04:50.233 --> 00:04:54.300
Because this set to true is the modern way

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:56.466
of building Angular components.

00:04:56.966 --> 00:05:00.500
And you can use that modern way with Angular 18 as well.

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.966
The rest of the component will be the same.

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:05.833
You just need to set standalone to true.

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:07.900
But with higher Angular versions,

00:05:08.233 --> 00:05:09.800
you don't even need to do that.

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:11.400
That's just important to note.

00:05:11.633 --> 00:05:12.966
Here, I'll set it to true

00:05:12.966 --> 00:05:15.166
so that it will work in either version.

00:05:15.733 --> 00:05:17.400
Because if you're setting this to true

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:19.633
in Angular 19 or higher,

00:05:19.866 --> 00:05:21.700
that of course also won't be a problem.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.766
You wouldn't need to do it there,

00:05:23.933 --> 00:05:26.266
but it of course creates no problem

00:05:26.266 --> 00:05:29.333
if you do explicitly set it to true there.

00:05:30.266 --> 00:05:32.966
Now, this property marks this Component

00:05:32.966 --> 00:05:35.966
as a so-called Standalone Component,

00:05:35.966 --> 00:05:40.066
and Angular also knows
other types of Components.

00:05:40.066 --> 00:05:42.833
For example, module based Components,

00:05:42.833 --> 00:05:46.233
which you would get if you
set standalone to false.

00:05:46.233 --> 00:05:49.600
Now, these different
Component formats exist

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:52.133
for historic reasons because

00:05:52.133 --> 00:05:56.333
in the past Angular only
new module based Components,

00:05:56.333 --> 00:05:59.833
but then it introduced
Standalone Components

00:05:59.833 --> 00:06:00.733
where this is set to true,

00:06:00.733 --> 00:06:05.366
which are simply a bit easier
to use and tie together.

00:06:05.366 --> 00:06:07.366
For the moment that's
all you need to know,

00:06:07.366 --> 00:06:09.533
later I'll have a separate section

00:06:09.533 --> 00:06:12.833
where I dive deeper into
module based Components

00:06:12.833 --> 00:06:15.366
and the difference to
Standalone Components.

00:06:15.366 --> 00:06:18.833
Since many projects out
there still use this

00:06:18.833 --> 00:06:21.233
old Component format,

00:06:21.233 --> 00:06:23.933
it is however the recommendation nowadays

00:06:23.933 --> 00:06:26.300
to work with Standalone Components,

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:29.000
so to set this to true
and that's therefore

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.600
what we will do here as well.

00:06:31.833 --> 00:06:35.866
Well, and with that, we now
prepared this header Component.

00:06:36.833 --> 00:06:40.233
The question now just is how do we use it.
