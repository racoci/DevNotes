00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:02.910
<v Maximilian>Another pretty important feature</v>

2
00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:06.690
offered by Angular is the feature of pipes,

3
00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.190
which in the end are output transformers you could say,

4
00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.450
things that transform output in templates.

5
00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.820
And a good example for such a pipe

6
00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.480
can be seen in the task.component.html file.

7
00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.600
Because here, we of course have this date,

8
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.390
this due date, which we're outputting.

9
00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.380
At the moment, it looks like this, which is not horrible,

10
00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.073
but maybe also not the most human readable way.

11
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.340
To output this in a nicer way,

12
00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.340
we can funnel this value through a pipe

13
00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:45.810
by using this pipe symbol,

14
00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:50.430
this vertical bar here after task.dueDate.

15
00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.160
And then after this pipe symbol,

16
00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.270
we add one of the pipes defined by Angular,

17
00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.930
so one of the pipes built into Angular.

18
00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.940
And you can also build your own pipes,

19
00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.680
and we'll do that later in the course,

20
00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.020
but for now, we'll use a built-in one.

21
00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.710
And the built-in pipe I wanna use is the date pipe,

22
00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.340
which as the name suggests is a transformer

23
00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.680
that's provided by Angular

24
00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.680
that aims to format dates in a more human readable way.

25
00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.930
Now, this date pipe currently is unknown,

26
00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.410
and at least at the point of time where I'm recording this,

27
00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:31.890
I also don't get such a import suggestion.

28
00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.570
But that's, of course, no problem.

29
00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.040
We can import it manually in the task component

30
00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:43.040
by importing the DatePipe written like this

31
00:01:43.572 --> 00:01:47.490
from @angular/common.

32
00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.310
So not from core, but from common.

33
00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.150
And then we add the DatePipe next to the CardComponent

34
00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:56.820
here in the imports array.

35
00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.320
With that, it's unlocked

36
00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.140
and it will now transform this date.

37
00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.943
As you can see, if you saved this,

38
00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.700
now this is formatted in a more human readable way.

39
00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.390
Now, this DatePipe also can be configured

40
00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.500
so that you can control how the date should be formatted,

41
00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.430
and you find more information in the official documentation.

42
00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.460
There, you also find a more detailed description

43
00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:26.340
and also detailed usage notes.

44
00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.000
Because in the end, those Angular pipes can be configured

45
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.500
by adding a colon after the pipe name

46
00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.760
and then thereafter any parameters,

47
00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.153
any configuration that should be passed to the pipe.

48
00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.680
For example, here, we could pass the string short

49
00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.680
to the DatePipe so that we get this formatting style here.

50
00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:50.580
So if we save this,

51
00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:53.883
we now would have this short formatting look here.

52
00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.240
Now, in my case, that's actually not what I want.

53
00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:00.870
Instead, I want this full date formatting,

54
00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:05.870
and therefore, I'll use fullDate as an option here.

55
00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.030
And with that, I get this output,

56
00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.640
which in my opinion looks better.

57
00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.133
And that's the concept of working with pipes.
