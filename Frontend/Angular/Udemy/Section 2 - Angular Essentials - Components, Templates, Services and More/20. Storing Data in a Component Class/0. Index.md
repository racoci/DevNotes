00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:01.860
<v Maximilian>Now, in order to output</v>

2
00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:03.840
some dynamic user data here,

3
00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.863
we first of all need to draw a random user.

4
00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.290
And to do that, I'll go to this user component class here

5
00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.840
and for the first time in this course,

6
00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:19.620
I'll add some code the body of that class,

7
00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:23.760
because that is something you can do with Angular components

8
00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.280
and something you sometimes need to do

9
00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:28.890
even though we haven't done it thus far.

10
00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.520
But thus far, we also didn't deal with any data

11
00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.180
that would need to be output on the screen,

12
00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.790
and that's what changes now.

13
00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.950
Now, in this user component class,

14
00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.740
when using TypeScript, as we do here,

15
00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:48.740
you can add a new property, for example, selectedUser,

16
00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.140
though the name is totally up to you.

17
00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.743
But you can simply add a variable.

18
00:00:54.743 --> 00:00:58.140
You could say like this in the class body

19
00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.920
just without let or const in front of it.

20
00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.470
You just add the name instead.

21
00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.600
And then you can use an equal sign

22
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.260
to assign a value to this property

23
00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.930
and this property and its value

24
00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.900
will then be made available by Angular

25
00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.210
to the template of this component

26
00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.133
and that's why we're doing this here.

27
00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.880
So now the value I wanna add here

28
00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.530
should be one of the users from that dummy-users-ts file.

29
00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.383
So I need to draw a random user from there.

30
00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.940
Now to do that, we can start by importing

31
00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.640
this DUMMY_USERS array

32
00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.640
from going up one level from inside user component

33
00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.470
to go out of this user folder,

34
00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.380
because the dummy-users.ts file is one folder

35
00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.183
above the user folder.

36
00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:00.363
And then we wanna target this dummy-users.ts file.

37
00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:04.593
With that, I'm now importing this DUMMY_USERS array.

38
00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.430
Now I wanna draw a user from there

39
00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:11.730
and we could do this by using the square bracket notation

40
00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.750
to for example, access the first user

41
00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.210
or the second on and so on.

42
00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:21.093
Just as you know it from JavaScript arrays.

43
00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:24.990
Now of course, that's not random though,

44
00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:27.003
that is a fixed number.

45
00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.470
To make this random, we can create

46
00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:35.770
a little helper constant here outside of this class

47
00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.633
and name it randomIndex for example.

48
00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.325
And then get a random number that's within the range

49
00:02:44.325 --> 00:02:48.000
of available indexes of this array

50
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.890
by using Math.floor and then Math.random

51
00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:57.723
times DUMMY_USERS.length.

52
00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.890
And this should give me a random number that's between zero

53
00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:05.343
and the highest available index of that array.

54
00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:10.410
And we can now use this randomIndex constant here

55
00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:14.643
instead of that zero to access a user at that random index.

56
00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:19.590
Now, that's all nice, but what's the advantage of that?

57
00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.136
Well, the advantage is that we can now access

58
00:03:22.136 --> 00:03:24.990
this selectedUser property

59
00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:28.683
from inside the template of this component.

60
00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:32.160
So all the properties you are defining

61
00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.920
in your component class are available

62
00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.260
in the template of that component.

63
00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.503
That is a core feature of Angular.

64
00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:46.710
Therefor, we can go to this user.component.html file

65
00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:50.970
and we can now output the name of that selectedUser.

66
00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:53.073
But how does that now work?
