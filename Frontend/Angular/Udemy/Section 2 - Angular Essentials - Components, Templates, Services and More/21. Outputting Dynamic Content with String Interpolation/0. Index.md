<v ->[Maximilian Schwarzmüller] When it comes to</v>

2
00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:05.310
outputting dynamic content in Angular applications,

3
00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:10.200
you get two main ways of binding your template

4
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.180
or parts of your template,

5
00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:15.600
two values generated by the component class,

6
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.903
so to the selected user property, for example.

7
00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:23.430
And the first way of binding a part of your template

8
00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.763
is by using so-called string interpolation,

9
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.910
which you do by using two

10
00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.540
opening and closing curly braces, like this.

11
00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.543
So opening and closing double curly braces.

12
00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:40.140
And then between those curly braces,

13
00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.128
you can now reference any public property

14
00:00:43.128 --> 00:00:46.110
of your component class.

15
00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.900
And this is a public property.

16
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.280
You could mark it as private

17
00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.230
by adding private in front of it.

18
00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.930
Then it would not be available in the template.

19
00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.350
It would then only be available within the class.

20
00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.090
But that's not what we want here.

21
00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.570
So by not adding private, it will automatically be public.

22
00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.840
And therefore in the user component template file,

23
00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.990
you can now target selected user

24
00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.170
and you should be getting some IDE support here

25
00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.813
if you're using visuals studio code, for example,

26
00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.100
and then use the dot notation on that property

27
00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.560
because the value stored in that property

28
00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.960
will be such a user object.

29
00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.960
Keep in mind that dummy users is an array

30
00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.123
full of objects that look like this,

31
00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.143
so that have an ID, a name and an avatar.

32
00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.398
And therefore here we can access .name.

33
00:01:38.398 --> 00:01:42.030
And again, you should be getting some IDE support here

34
00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.170
since the IDE, thanks to some tools provided

35
00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.700
under the hood by Angular,

36
00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.680
understands this connection

37
00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.230
between template and component class

38
00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:54.393
and the structure of our data.

39
00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.830
And this is then how you can output

40
00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:03.830
dynamic text or dynamic content in general in your templates

41
00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.010
by using this string interpolation feature

42
00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:10.113
with the double curly braces.

43
00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.940
If you do that and you save everything,

44
00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:16.140
you should then see

45
00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.870
that every time you reload this application,

46
00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.000
you are seeing a different name.

47
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.820
Well, you might sometimes see the same name twice in a row

48
00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:25.320
because it is random,

49
00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:28.203
but it should change fairly frequently.
