00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.530
<v ->[Maximilian Schwarzmüller] So at the moment,</v>

2
00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:03.150
the image and the name here,

3
00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:05.040
of course, are not final.

4
00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:06.390
They're just placeholders

5
00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:08.943
and the image is actually not displaying anything.

6
00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.870
Now the finished app we're building here

7
00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.723
should actually support multiple users.

8
00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.540
That's why attached you find a dummy.users.ts file,

9
00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:26.010
which you can copy and paste right into your app folder

10
00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.563
next to the app component for example.

11
00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.730
This file then includes an array with some dummy user data

12
00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.520
where every user has an ID, a name, and an image identifier.

13
00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:45.060
Now, at the moment, we don't have those images yet,

14
00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:49.830
but that's why attached you also find a user's zip file,

15
00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:51.930
which you can download and extract

16
00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.790
to then copy all the images

17
00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:56.310
you'll find in the extracted folder

18
00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:59.730
into a user's folder in your assets folder.

19
00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.790
So that in the assets folder you have a user's folder.

20
00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:05.943
And in there you have all these user images.

21
00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.640
And the names of these images are the image identifiers

22
00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.493
you'll find in the dummy user's ts file.

23
00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.520
And now with that added,

24
00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.520
my goal now is to draw a random user from that list of users

25
00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.230
inside of that user component

26
00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.880
and to then output the name and image

27
00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.103
of that randomly drawn user.

28
00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:37.050
And to achieve this and implement this feature,

29
00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:40.740
we'll now finally have to learn about some Angular features

30
00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.190
that allow us to output dynamic content.

31
00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:48.120
Because thus far, all the markup we wrote has been static.

32
00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:50.223
There has been nothing dynamic in it.

33
00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.420
But now since we plan on drawing different users,

34
00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.300
we need to change this markup in the user component

35
00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:01.590
such that it can output different images and different names

36
00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.150
with the same markup.

37
00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:05.133
And that's what we'll dive in next.
