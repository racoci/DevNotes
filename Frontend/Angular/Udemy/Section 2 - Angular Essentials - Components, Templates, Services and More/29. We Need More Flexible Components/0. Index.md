00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:02.100
<v Maximilian>At this point,</v>

2
00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.480
we covered a lot of crucial Angular concepts already.

3
00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.427
But of course, the demo application we are working on

4
00:00:09.427 --> 00:00:12.210
didn't make too much progress.

5
00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.820
But it is of course super important

6
00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.770
to have this solid foundation

7
00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.885
and to know about all these core concepts

8
00:00:18.885 --> 00:00:21.933
I did explain over the last lectures.

9
00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:23.730
That being said,

10
00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.180
I now wanna continue working on this UI though.

11
00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.930
And for example, the idea with this user here, of course,

12
00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:33.404
is not to have a single user

13
00:00:33.404 --> 00:00:36.540
that changes whenever we click on them,

14
00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.510
but instead to have a list of users here

15
00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.850
where we have multiple user items,

16
00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.835
which when we click on them, load their tasks,

17
00:00:44.835 --> 00:00:47.343
which should then show up on the right here.

18
00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:49.740
And therefore as a next step,

19
00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:52.710
I wanna work on that list of users.

20
00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.430
And therefore, I first wanna make sure

21
00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.570
that this user component can be used multiple times

22
00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.410
so that we can use one and the same user component here

23
00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:08.130
multiple times but with different data.

24
00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.440
Because that's another big advantage

25
00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.350
of this Components approach.

26
00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.119
You don't just split your user interface

27
00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:19.020
into those building blocks,

28
00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.950
hence simplifying those individual building blocks.

29
00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.600
But you also have reusable building blocks.

30
00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.470
And of course, not every component needs to be reused.

31
00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.880
The HeaderComponent, for example, is only used once here,

32
00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.766
but some components are reused like this UserComponent,

33
00:01:40.766 --> 00:01:43.740
which is meant to be output multiple times

34
00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.453
with different data.

35
00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.380
Now of course, we can go to the AppComponent here

36
00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.290
and simply copy and paste this list item

37
00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.110
with the UserComponent multiple times

38
00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.363
to output multiple users like this.

39
00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.995
But if we do that, it's always the same user,

40
00:02:01.995 --> 00:02:05.220
at least initially until we change it.

41
00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:07.440
And it's always the same user initially,

42
00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.660
because in the UserComponent

43
00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.200
we initially calculate this random index,

44
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.130
and this is done only once when this file is first parsed.

45
00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.710
And then, we use this random index

46
00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:24.710
to select one random user, which we use as a starting value.

47
00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.330
And that's of course not the idea.

48
00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.180
Instead, I actually don't wanna pick

49
00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.410
any random index or random user at all here.

50
00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:37.650
And I also don't wanna change the selected user

51
00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:42.090
when we click on them so we can get rid of this code here.

52
00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.480
I also don't need a selected user here at all

53
00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.870
because the idea is not to show different users

54
00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.396
inside of the UserComponent.

55
00:02:51.396 --> 00:02:53.490
So we can get rid of all of that

56
00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:55.953
and clean up this UserComponent class.

57
00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:00.370
And therefore, of course, also get rid of this import here

58
00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:04.620
and get rid of the compute and signal functions

59
00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:05.823
that are being imported.

60
00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:09.717
Because instead, I want to make

61
00:03:09.717 --> 00:03:13.221
my app UserComponent configurable

62
00:03:13.221 --> 00:03:18.221
so that we can set attributes, properties to be precise,

63
00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:21.990
on that component here, on that element tag,

64
00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:25.290
just as we can do it on built-in elements.

65
00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:26.640
That would be a nice feature

66
00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.570
because that would then allow us to really reuse

67
00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:34.980
one and the same component, but with different data.

68
00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.350
And that is of course, a crucial feature

69
00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:39.963
that is supported by Angular.
