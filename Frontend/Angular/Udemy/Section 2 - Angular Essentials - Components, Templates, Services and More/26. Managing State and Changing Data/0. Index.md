00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.540
<v Instructor>Now that we know how we can react to events,</v>

2
00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.800
and that we know how we can output dynamic content,

3
00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:11.550
we can bring these two things together,

4
00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.330
as you often will do when building Angular applications

5
00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.310
so that we can update the UI

6
00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.410
and what's visible on the screen

7
00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.410
whenever this user here is clicked,

8
00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.890
so that instead of just outputting something to the console,

9
00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.900
we update the UI.

10
00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.570
For example, we could change the user

11
00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.900
that's displayed here, every time it's clicked,

12
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.990
so that instead of changing it only when the page reloads,

13
00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:39.270
we could do that when the user is clicked.

14
00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.390
And for this, we now need to manage some data

15
00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:43.980
in our component class,

16
00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.630
which when changed has an impact on the UI.

17
00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:52.830
And this kind of data is often also called state

18
00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:55.440
because it is data that will have an impact

19
00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.010
on the state of our user interface.

20
00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.260
And setting up and using such state

21
00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.510
is actually pretty straightforward

22
00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.280
when working with Angular.

23
00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.320
Indeed, you actually don't need to set up

24
00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.390
anything special at all,

25
00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.270
unlike in some other libraries or frameworks

26
00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.580
you could be using instead of Angular,

27
00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.250
instead here in our user component,

28
00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.150
we just need to change the value of selected user

29
00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.840
whenever this method down here gets executed.

30
00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.480
So in this method, instead of console logging,

31
00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:29.893
we wanna set this selected user

32
00:01:29.893 --> 00:01:32.553
to a different selected user.

33
00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.030
And for that of course we can copy this code

34
00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.680
and paste it in there,

35
00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.880
but we now also need to make sure that random index changes

36
00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.283
every time this method executes.

37
00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.110
Because at the moment it's only calculated once, initially

38
00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.370
when this file gets passed and never changed thereafter.

39
00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:55.650
So in order to get a new random number,

40
00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:59.250
we can of course simply copy this entire line here

41
00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.030
and paste it into on select user,

42
00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.270
so that we generate a new locally scoped

43
00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.130
random index constant

44
00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:11.490
that's only available inside of on select user.

45
00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:15.810
And that overrides this global random index constant

46
00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.540
inside of this method here at least.

47
00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.640
And we then use this random index,

48
00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.940
which is recalculated every time this method runs

49
00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:28.263
to extract and Store a new user from dummy users.

50
00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.580
So the selected user property gets changed

51
00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:35.490
every time this method executes now,

52
00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:36.900
and this method executes

53
00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.360
whenever this button is clicked.

54
00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.120
Therefore, with this simple change made,

55
00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.640
if we now reload and we click,

56
00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.750
you see that the users will change.

57
00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:53.640
And that's how easy it is to manage data in Angular,

58
00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.870
which when changed has an impact on the UI.

59
00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.480
You simply change the properties

60
00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.850
you are outputting in your template.

61
00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:04.983
It's as simple as that.
