00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:02.430
<v Instructor>Now to use this custom header component,</v>

2
00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:04.980
we could go to the index HTML file

3
00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.370
where we're also using this app root component,

4
00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:09.810
so the app component,

5
00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:13.290
and there we could add app dash header,

6
00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.243
opening and closing like this.

7
00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.200
If you would save this though,

8
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.620
you would see no difference on the screen.

9
00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:24.210
There, you would not see

10
00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.930
that new header component markup that we set up.

11
00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.000
It's nowhere to be found here.

12
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.970
Also not if we inspect this page here

13
00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:34.470
and the rendered elements.

14
00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:37.620
There, indeed we would see app header,

15
00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.080
but it would be an empty HTML element

16
00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:41.760
that doesn't do anything

17
00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.280
because the browser doesn't recognize it

18
00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.130
and Angular actually ignores it

19
00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:49.290
because what's important to understand

20
00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:52.410
as an Angular developer is that Angular

21
00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.500
is not automatically scanning all your files

22
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.810
and folders and looking for components

23
00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:59.760
you might be defining.

24
00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.820
Instead, you have to explicitly tell Angular

25
00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.943
if you have a new component and you wanna use it somewhere.

26
00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.740
And that's for example, what's happening in the main.ts file

27
00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.623
with help of that bootstrap application function.

28
00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.810
This function tells Angular that there is an app component

29
00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.620
and that it should look for this component's tag

30
00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:24.840
in the index HTML file

31
00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.143
to display the content of this component on the screen.

32
00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:31.470
Therefore, what we could of course do

33
00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.650
is also call bootstrap application

34
00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.773
and pass our header component to it.

35
00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.610
We would simply import header component,

36
00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.990
our class from this header component TypeScript file

37
00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.990
without the extension as you learned,

38
00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.653
and pass it to another bootstrap application call.

39
00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.520
If you would do that and you save everything,

40
00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.000
you would indeed see that now the headers component

41
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.710
is visible on the screen.

42
00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.810
So now Angular is aware of it

43
00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.473
and finds its tag and renders its content.

44
00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.000
However, this is typically not how you would render

45
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.290
this component because the idea with Angular in the end

46
00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.920
is that you build a tree of components

47
00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.080
where you have one component,

48
00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:26.580
the root component typically the app component at the top,

49
00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.710
and then you have other components

50
00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:30.930
nested inside of that component

51
00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.660
or nested inside of other components.

52
00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:37.620
And this is not just some arbitrary design decision

53
00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.660
made by the Angular team.

54
00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:44.010
Instead, the idea behind building such a component tree

55
00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:48.060
is that those components that are part of the same tree,

56
00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.940
part of the same Angular application,

57
00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:54.240
therefore will be able to work together

58
00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:57.090
and exchange data for example,

59
00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.340
and communicate with each other,

60
00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.010
something you'll learn about in depth

61
00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.080
throughout this course.

62
00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.690
And therefore the idea is that you would typically

63
00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:09.480
only call bootstrap application once

64
00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.390
with that one main root component

65
00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:15.420
and then you use any other components

66
00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.940
in that components template

67
00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:21.243
or in templates of other nested components.

68
00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:25.830
So we would use our header component here inside

69
00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:27.750
of the template of the app component.

70
00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:28.923
That's the idea.

71
00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:33.300
For example, we could replace this dummy header here

72
00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:36.510
of that starting page I prepared for you

73
00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:41.170
with our app dash header custom component tag

74
00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:44.940
because that is the tag we're looking for

75
00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:49.350
because of this selector, app dash header.

76
00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:51.090
That's what I'm now using here

77
00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:54.933
as an element in the app components HTML file.

78
00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:59.010
However, if you add this here,

79
00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:01.500
you'll see that now you'll get an error.

80
00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.810
If you take a look at this terminal

81
00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:06.450
where you started the development server

82
00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:11.070
by running NPM start, you see that there you get an error

83
00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:14.553
that app dash header is not a known element.

84
00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.730
And again, the reason for that is that Angular

85
00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:20.370
doesn't scan all your files and folders

86
00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:23.190
and automatically register components.

87
00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:26.220
Instead as mentioned, you have to inform Angular

88
00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:28.090
about any components you created

89
00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:32.700
and you do that when using a component inside

90
00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:36.060
of another components template as we're doing it here

91
00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:40.680
by going to the component in which template you are using

92
00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:41.790
another component.

93
00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:43.350
So in this case the app component,

94
00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:44.610
because it's the template

95
00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:47.100
of the app component in which we are using

96
00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:48.360
another component.

97
00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.240
And you then register that other component

98
00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:54.690
you wanna use in this component's template.

99
00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:57.630
And that's done by importing that other component.

100
00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:59.620
So in this case the header component

101
00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:03.570
from this component's file,

102
00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:06.573
so header.component without the file extension,

103
00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:10.920
and then you add it to this imports property,

104
00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:13.200
which you also find on this app component

105
00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:16.890
configuration object because this configuration

106
00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:20.340
in the end works together with this standalone feature

107
00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:23.970
such that it registers all the things,

108
00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:27.060
all the standalone components, for example,

109
00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:30.483
that you wanna use in the template of this app component.

110
00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:35.310
So you simply pass header component like this

111
00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:40.310
to this imports array and that now unlocks this component

112
00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:43.203
for the template of this app component.

113
00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:47.820
And therefore with this done, if you now save this

114
00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:50.010
and you have this development server up and running,

115
00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:53.850
it should automatically reload and re-execute your code.

116
00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:55.590
Now the error should be gone

117
00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:58.260
and you should now see that content on the screen,

118
00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:02.130
but now it's loaded in the way you typically would load

119
00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:05.220
and render other components by adding them

120
00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:06.873
to your component tree.
