00:00:00.768 --> 00:00:02.880
<v ->[Maximilian Schwarzmüller] Now in the previous lecture,</v>

2
00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:06.000
I added this task interface here,

3
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.333
this custom task type definition in the end.

4
00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.320
And we did something similar earlier

5
00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.733
for the user type here in the user component file.

6
00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.270
Now, whilst you can do it like this,

7
00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.480
it is quite common in Angular apps

8
00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.220
to outsource crucial type definitions like these

9
00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.200
into separate files.

10
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.960
It's not a technical requirement,

11
00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.090
as you can tell since everything works

12
00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.000
and it's also not something you have to do,

13
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.190
but it is a common pattern.

14
00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.983
And I'll start with this user type here.

15
00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.495
You would typically create a separate file in the folder

16
00:00:48.495 --> 00:00:52.380
to which this data model belongs.

17
00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:54.210
So if you are describing a user,

18
00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.943
it makes sense to be stored in the user folder.

19
00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:00.090
You would add a new file here

20
00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.920
and then typically name it user.model.ts.

21
00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.691
And now you can simply cut this interface here,

22
00:01:08.691 --> 00:01:10.800
this user interface,

23
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.410
and also delete this commented out type

24
00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:14.530
since we don't need it

25
00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.383
and paste that interface into this user model file.

26
00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.790
Now, in order to make it available outside of this file,

27
00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.003
you also have to add the export keyword though.

28
00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:30.780
And now with this, the advantage is

29
00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.710
that you can now easily use this type definition

30
00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.453
in any file that needs it.

31
00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.520
In this app, it is only that one user component file,

32
00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.170
so it's not too important.

33
00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.350
But if you were using that same data model,

34
00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.920
that same data type in different files

35
00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.940
defining it in a central place like this and exporting it,

36
00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:55.770
simply make sure that you don't have

37
00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.250
to copy and paste type definitions around.

38
00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.740
Therefore, now with that type being stored

39
00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.180
in that extra file,

40
00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.930
we have to import this user data definition

41
00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.280
from ./user.model.

42
00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.443
And with that, everything works again.

43
00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.320
And that's also important.

44
00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.480
When working with TypeScript,

45
00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.330
you can import type definitions

46
00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.663
just as you can import classes and so on.

47
00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.670
If you know that something is a type definition,

48
00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.130
you can add the type keyword in front of it

49
00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:33.780
to make that super clear

50
00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.030
though technically this is not required.

51
00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.160
But you might want to do that to make it very clear

52
00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.793
that what we're importing here is just a type definition.

53
00:02:43.649 --> 00:02:47.550
And you can now do something similar for the task.

54
00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:51.003
And you can of course also try doing this on your own first.

55
00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:57.770
I will outsource it by again, grabbing this interface here

56
00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:02.460
so that it's not in the task component file anymore.

57
00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:04.830
And now since I'm describing a task,

58
00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:08.610
I'll stay in this task sub folder,

59
00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:12.213
and in there I'll add a task.model.ts file.

60
00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:14.820
And then just as before,

61
00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:18.153
we put the interface in there and export it,

62
00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:23.280
and now in the file where we need it, we can import it.

63
00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.800
So here in the task component file,

64
00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:30.800
we import this type task from ./task.model.

65
00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:36.120
And again, as mentioned,

66
00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.370
this is not something you have to do,

67
00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:40.050
but a common pattern you will see

68
00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:42.063
in many Angular applications.
