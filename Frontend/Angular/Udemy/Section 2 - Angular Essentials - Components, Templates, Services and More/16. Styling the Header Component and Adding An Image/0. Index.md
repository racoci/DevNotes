00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:02.580
<v Maximilian>So we can now see the content</v>

2
00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.490
of our header component on the screen,

3
00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.790
but, of course, it doesn't really look the way I want it

4
00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.470
to look yet.

5
00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:13.143
And we can change this by adding some styles,

6
00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.430
which is typically done by adding a new file,

7
00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.880
a header.component.css file in this case.

8
00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.433
Again, using that same naming pattern,

9
00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:27.390
and by then linking to that style file inside

10
00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.740
of the header.component TypeScript file

11
00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:35.550
by setting up the styleUrl configuration property here,

12
00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.480
which just like templateUrl wants a relative path

13
00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.313
to that style file.

14
00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.663
So in this case, to header.component.css.

15
00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.980
By the way, there also is a styleUrls property you can set,

16
00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:54.600
which would take an array

17
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.833
of multiple external style files that should be considered.

18
00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.330
And there also is just a styles property,

19
00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:06.420
which you could also set, which wants an array

20
00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.680
of inline styles where you define the CSS styles

21
00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.530
right inside of this TypeScript file

22
00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.200
so that you could set up your CSS rules

23
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.633
like this right inside of this file.

24
00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.880
That would work but just as with inline templates,

25
00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.460
it's actually a discouraged pattern

26
00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.550
and the most common way of linking to external files

27
00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:32.250
is therefore with styleUrls

28
00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.933
or if it's just a single file, with styleUrl like this.

29
00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:40.890
Now, since this is not a CSS course,

30
00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.190
we won't write the style code together though,

31
00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:46.410
but instead, attached you find a link

32
00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:49.560
to a header.component.css file,

33
00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.870
which I prepared in advance,

34
00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:54.420
which you can simply copy into your project

35
00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.450
or you can copy the styles defined in that file

36
00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.063
into your header.component.css file.

37
00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.320
And attached, you actually also find

38
00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.633
some other assets and files.

39
00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.610
For example, a task-management-logo.png file,

40
00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:12.690
which you should copy

41
00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.480
and paste into your assets folder

42
00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.683
because we'll soon use this image in our header markup.

43
00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:25.470
And you also find an updated styles.css file,

44
00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.550
which you should use to replace your styles.css file,

45
00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:32.523
which you find directly in the Ssrc folder.

46
00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.290
This style file sets up some global styles

47
00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.230
that will apply to all components,

48
00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.430
whereas the component-specific style files set up styles

49
00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.210
that apply only to the components they belong to,

50
00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:52.023
so they can't clash with styles of other components.

51
00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.110
We also need some global styles though,

52
00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:59.010
and that's why you find an updated styles.css file attached

53
00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.163
and you can simply replace yours with the attached one.

54
00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:08.600
Now, this attached file also uses some special fontd,

55
00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.790
which we can import from Google Fonts

56
00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:16.080
and therefore, you should also go to the index.html file

57
00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.270
and you should replace this file

58
00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:21.720
with the index.html file you find attached

59
00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:25.260
to simply add those extra links here,

60
00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.323
which import fonts from Google Fonts.

61
00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:33.183
That's the only change I made with that index.html file.

62
00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:38.880
Well, and with all that done, we now improved the styling

63
00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:41.880
and therefore, as a last step, you should go

64
00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.610
to the header.component.html file

65
00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:47.190
to also update the markup

66
00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:50.838
because in there, I now also wanna output an image

67
00:03:50.838 --> 00:03:54.400
which we can do with the default img element

68
00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.510
and set the src

69
00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:02.510
to assets/task-management-logo.png.

70
00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:10.380
So to that file you find attached to this lecture,

71
00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:13.980
this task-management-logo.png file.

72
00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:15.720
It's in the assets folder.

73
00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:19.410
So that's also the path we set up here.

74
00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:21.270
And Angular will then make sure

75
00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:23.823
that it gets loaded onto the page correctly.

76
00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:27.153
We can also set up some alt text here,

77
00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:30.360
like "A todo list",

78
00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:34.170
because that is what can be seen on that image.

79
00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:37.920
Now, when loading an image from the assets file,

80
00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:39.540
like we're doing it here,

81
00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:43.440
there is one important thing you should check,

82
00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:45.750
and that's in the angular.json file

83
00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:48.750
in your root project folder.

84
00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:50.460
In there, you should make sure

85
00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:53.160
that you have this assets configuration,

86
00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:54.690
which should be an array.

87
00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:59.463
And that there you have this src/assets entry.

88
00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:03.510
If it instead looks something like this

89
00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:05.910
where you don't have that assets entry,

90
00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:08.250
but where instead you might have a configuration object

91
00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:11.760
like this, you should make sure that you simply add

92
00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:16.350
that src/assets string to that array, just like this.

93
00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:19.410
Otherwise the image can't be loaded.

94
00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:23.040
You should also make sure that you add this path

95
00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:26.223
to the favicon here so that you see that as well.

96
00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:30.870
If you're using the started project I provided

97
00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:32.460
at the beginning of this section,

98
00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:34.380
that will already be the case though,

99
00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:36.300
and you don't need to make any changes

100
00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:38.820
to that angular.json file.

101
00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:40.440
And then for styling purposes,

102
00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:43.560
I wanna wrap this h1 element into a div element

103
00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:45.810
and add a paragraph

104
00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:50.810
where I'll say enterprise-level task management

105
00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:52.650
without friction.

106
00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:54.963
Of course, you can use any text you want.

107
00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:58.890
With all these changes made,

108
00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:01.380
with that development server up and running,

109
00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:03.660
they will be picked up automatically

110
00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:06.600
and you should now see this header on the screen

111
00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:08.703
if you reload the application.

112
00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:12.030
And that's therefore, a huge step forward

113
00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:16.920
because that's now our finished first custom component,

114
00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:18.393
the header.component.
