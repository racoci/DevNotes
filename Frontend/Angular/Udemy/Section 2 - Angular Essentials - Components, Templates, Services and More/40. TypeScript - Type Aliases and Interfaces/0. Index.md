00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.430
<v ->[Maximilian Schwarzmüller] Now since certain types,</v>

2
00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:05.070
like this object type here, for example,

3
00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:09.270
can become rather complex and a bit longer,

4
00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:13.170
it is also quite common to outsource them

5
00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.150
and to not define them in line as I'm doing it here.

6
00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.030
And you can do that with TypeScript

7
00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:24.420
by grabbing the type you want to outsource,

8
00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.843
and by creating a so-called type alias.

9
00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:30.960
You do that with the type keyword,

10
00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.563
which is a keyword made available by TypeScript,

11
00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.730
and then you pick any type name of your choice.

12
00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.590
For example, user.

13
00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.480
And the convention is to start

14
00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.283
with an uppercase character here.

15
00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:48.510
Then you use an equal sign, but as a value,

16
00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.700
you now assign a type definition

17
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.553
because this is a pure TypeScript feature.

18
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.803
So in this case, this user object type I just cut.

19
00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.760
And now you can use your own type here,

20
00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.370
just type alias, user in my case,

21
00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:10.230
in all the places where this type is expected and required,

22
00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:11.523
like this now.

23
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.230
Now when you are dealing with an object type

24
00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:18.270
as we do it here,

25
00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.710
you also have an alternative to setting up a type like this.

26
00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.930
You can create a so-called interface,

27
00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.050
which is another TypeScript feature.

28
00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:30.660
And an interface is simply another way

29
00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:34.110
of defining an object type, you could say.

30
00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.260
And you'll see both approaches out there in the wild,

31
00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:41.070
which is why I will show you both approaches here.

32
00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.940
Now the question whether to use a type or an interface

33
00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:47.910
is a question that can lead to a long discussion.

34
00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:50.700
The short answer is that in many situations

35
00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.970
it doesn't matter and you can use what you prefer.

36
00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.469
In Angular projects,

37
00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:58.800
it's a bit more common to see interfaces,

38
00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.023
but ultimately it is down to you.

39
00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.120
If you were to define such a object type as an interface,

40
00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:09.720
you would do that by using the interface keyword

41
00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.713
and then by again, using any name of your choice, like user.

42
00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.530
And then without an equal sign, you add curly braces

43
00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.770
and then your property definitions.

44
00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:24.933
So like this.

45
00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.920
And now you would have the same result as before

46
00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.830
just with this different approach.

47
00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:35.430
Again, you would have your own object type.

48
00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.760
One key difference to the type keyword is

49
00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:43.760
that with interface you can really only define object types.

50
00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.210
With the type keyword, you can also define other types

51
00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:51.480
of which you'll see some later in this course.

52
00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.250
And therefore, now with that,

53
00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.980
we got the same application as before.

54
00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:57.840
It still works as before,

55
00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.600
but now you learn a bit more about TypeScript

56
00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.270
and you will need that knowledge

57
00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:04.740
for the rest of this course,

58
00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:06.330
and also most importantly,

59
00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:09.063
when working as an Angular developer.
