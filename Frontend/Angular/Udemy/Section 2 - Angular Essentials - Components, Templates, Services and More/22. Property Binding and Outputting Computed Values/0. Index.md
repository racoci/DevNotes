00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:02.670
<v Maximilian>Now string interpolation</v>

2
00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:04.440
with the double curly braces

3
00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.850
is one of the key features offered by Angular

4
00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:12.420
when it comes to outputting content in your template.

5
00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.420
Another crucial syntax or feature offered by Angular

6
00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.540
is the so-called property binding syntax.

7
00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:23.850
Because we of course also wanna make sure

8
00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.150
that we show an image of the user

9
00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.720
and for that, we need to set the src attribute,

10
00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:31.863
for example.

11
00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.040
Now, you could indeed do that

12
00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.130
by also using the double curly braces syntax

13
00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:39.900
between those quotes

14
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:43.200
because you can use it anywhere in your template,

15
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.740
not just between tags as we're doing it here.

16
00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:51.000
So you could then access selectedUser.avatar.

17
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.030
And if you would do that and save everything,

18
00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.100
you should see some output here.

19
00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.860
Actually not the image yet

20
00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:01.980
because the path is not entirely correct yet

21
00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.263
but you see that something changed.

22
00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:09.420
However, you would typically not use string interpolation

23
00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.090
for attributes like this.

24
00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.760
You typically only use it between tags

25
00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.410
as we're doing it here.

26
00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:18.390
Instead, in cases like this,

27
00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.320
if you want to configure an element through its attributes,

28
00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.070
you would typically use another core Angular feature

29
00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.480
called property binding, which looks like this.

30
00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.700
You don't have curly braces,

31
00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.840
instead you wrap the name of the property

32
00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.980
of the DOM element you want to configure,

33
00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:43.620
so of this image element, in this case.

34
00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:46.410
You wrap the name of the property that should be set

35
00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:48.690
with square brackets,

36
00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:51.330
so opening and closing square brackets

37
00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:53.163
around the property name.

38
00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.880
And then inside of those quotes,

39
00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.500
you set the value that should be assigned to this property,

40
00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.513
without curly braces.

41
00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.970
Now, selectedUser.avatar is actually not entirely correct

42
00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.300
because those images are stored in the assets folder

43
00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.730
and they are in the users folder,

44
00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.760
so the image name alone is not enough,

45
00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.270
and that's why we here actually want to construct

46
00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:22.650
a dynamic path

47
00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.910
and concatenate that with selectedUser.avatar.

48
00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.870
And then in that string created with single quotes here,

49
00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.560
since I'm using double quotes to wrap the overall value,

50
00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.560
we set up the rest of the path which is assets/users/

51
00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:44.013
and then the name of the user image file.

52
00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.870
And that is something you can do in Angular.

53
00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.320
You cannot just reference properties

54
00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:55.770
in places where you reference dynamic data,

55
00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:59.400
but you can also create dynamic values just in time,

56
00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.980
so to say, as I'm doing it here,

57
00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.220
by constructing a string from a fixed string

58
00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.920
that's then combined with that value

59
00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.527
that's stored in the avatar property of the selectedUser.

60
00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:14.670
And we could have done something similar down here

61
00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.550
with string interpolation as well.

62
00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:19.980
You can also have other JavaScript expressions

63
00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:23.160
like 1 + 1 in there if you needed it.

64
00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.490
But in most cases, you will indeed refer to properties

65
00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:29.130
and any values stored inside of them

66
00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:31.470
just as we're doing it here.

67
00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:34.230
Well, and with that, to finish this image,

68
00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:39.230
I also wanna bind the alt property on the image tag,

69
00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.940
on the image element,

70
00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:46.763
and I'll bind this to selectedUser.name again.

71
00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:50.280
And then I'll press the code formatting shortcut

72
00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.440
that's built into Visual Studio Code

73
00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.870
so that the code gets formatted like this

74
00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:56.703
and is a bit easier to read.

75
00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:01.020
And with all that done, if you now save that,

76
00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:03.330
you should see that if you now reload,

77
00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:06.180
you also got a image here next to that name

78
00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:09.300
that changes with every reload.

79
00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:12.420
And that is how you can output dynamic data

80
00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:14.580
in your Angular apps,

81
00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:17.940
and string interpolation and property binding

82
00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:21.060
are two of the most important features

83
00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:23.850
you have to know when working with Angular

84
00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:28.410
because in the end, Angular is all about building dynamic,

85
00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:30.510
interactive web applications

86
00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:33.270
and that of course implies that you must be able

87
00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:35.253
to output dynamic data.
