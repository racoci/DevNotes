00:01.650 --> 00:04.560
-: To wrap this animation introduction up,

00:04.560 --> 00:06.600
there are a couple of callbacks you can listen

00:06.600 --> 00:09.120
to so that when an animation finish

00:09.120 --> 00:11.700
you might want to execute some other code.

00:11.700 --> 00:13.650
So here in app component,

00:13.650 --> 00:17.310
let's say on that div element here, we can listen

00:17.310 --> 00:20.400
to these callbacks here.

00:20.400 --> 00:22.230
We set up event binding

00:22.230 --> 00:24.750
but then again with the at sign to indicate that we're

00:24.750 --> 00:25.890
in the animation world.

00:25.890 --> 00:27.600
Like here with the property binding where

00:27.600 --> 00:31.020
we all use the at sign, we set up the trigger here.

00:31.020 --> 00:33.540
So div state for this div

00:33.540 --> 00:37.890
and then we got the start and the done trigger.

00:37.890 --> 00:42.890
This method will get executed whenever the animation starts.

00:43.170 --> 00:45.690
So here we could say animation...

00:45.690 --> 00:49.410
Animation started execute this method

00:49.410 --> 00:51.450
and let's pass the event exposed

00:51.450 --> 00:53.643
by Angular two to see what's inside of it.

00:54.570 --> 00:59.467
And I also wanna listen to the finishing with

01:00.900 --> 01:02.220
the done event

01:02.220 --> 01:07.220
on our trigger animation ended and all past event there.

01:07.410 --> 01:08.910
And then in the app component

01:08.910 --> 01:11.280
I wanna set up the two methods here.

01:11.280 --> 01:14.910
So animation started, which receives some event.

01:14.910 --> 01:17.460
And here I wanna simply lock this event

01:17.460 --> 01:19.680
so that we can see what's inside.

01:19.680 --> 01:22.890
And then animation ended with the event.

01:22.890 --> 01:23.950
And also

01:24.990 --> 01:26.250
log

01:26.250 --> 01:27.780
this event here.

01:27.780 --> 01:31.953
With that, let's save this and reload this application here.

01:33.960 --> 01:35.910
And now if I click animate,

01:35.910 --> 01:39.630
you see we had the starting and the ending animation fired.

01:39.630 --> 01:41.700
And here you see what's inside the event.

01:41.700 --> 01:45.540
We see the starting state, the to state, and the timing

01:45.540 --> 01:47.010
and the same is true for --

01:47.010 --> 01:51.690
the same data is part of the animation ended event

01:51.690 --> 01:53.850
object Angular two gives us.

01:53.850 --> 01:55.830
So these callbacks might be useful

01:55.830 --> 01:59.580
for you if you have some code which animate something.

01:59.580 --> 02:01.118
But after the animation finishes

02:01.118 --> 02:03.480
you wanna execute some other code.

02:03.480 --> 02:05.340
And you can do that by listening

02:05.340 --> 02:09.723
to these built in start and done events on your trigger.

02:10.560 --> 02:11.850
I hope with that,

02:11.850 --> 02:15.150
you feel a bit more comfortable using animations.

02:15.150 --> 02:16.710
You've got a nice introduction

02:16.710 --> 02:19.710
to how you might create your own animations in Angular two,

02:19.710 --> 02:22.890
how you can animate things in your Angular two application.

02:22.890 --> 02:25.200
And with that, play around with it.

02:25.200 --> 02:28.170
Set your own challenges, take your existing projects,

02:28.170 --> 02:30.960
maybe do a recipe book and animate some things.

02:30.960 --> 02:32.040
This is a challenge.

02:32.040 --> 02:33.990
This is where you'll learn the most.

02:33.990 --> 02:35.400
See you in other modules.

02:35.400 --> 02:36.233
Bye.
