00:01.530 --> 00:03.390
Instructor: Thus far, we only have starting

00:03.390 --> 00:04.260
and ending state.

00:04.260 --> 00:06.690
Now, let's play around with the animate function.

00:06.690 --> 00:09.990
We actually cannot only pass the timing,

00:09.990 --> 00:13.170
we can control the whole animation and define

00:13.170 --> 00:16.740
styles the animation should take during the animation.

00:16.740 --> 00:20.280
For that, I will pass a second argument here which is

00:20.280 --> 00:23.070
the style method. Again, we're already importing that.

00:23.070 --> 00:26.040
And as I can define a style in a state, I can also

00:26.040 --> 00:28.290
define a style during the animation.

00:28.290 --> 00:31.020
So here I also pass a JavaScript object,

00:31.020 --> 00:33.120
and that in-between style will now be

00:33.120 --> 00:35.670
taken during the installation.

00:35.670 --> 00:39.120
So here, let's say I want to give this a border

00:39.120 --> 00:43.860
radius of 50 pixels. Now let's see how that looks.

00:43.860 --> 00:47.970
If I save this with this extra style during the animation,

00:47.970 --> 00:50.220
if I hit shrink

00:50.220 --> 00:52.920
you see, it now looks kind of ugly

00:52.920 --> 00:55.590
because now we let these border radius

00:55.590 --> 00:57.690
or we let it, well, get round,

00:57.690 --> 01:01.500
but once it finishes, it instantly jumps to the end state.

01:01.500 --> 01:03.870
So this is not really what we want.

01:03.870 --> 01:08.010
We want to smoothly have this in between our animation

01:08.010 --> 01:11.460
and not animate the changing of the border radius

01:11.460 --> 01:14.490
and then instantly jump to the end state.

01:14.490 --> 01:18.570
To cater for such needs, we would replace this

01:18.570 --> 01:23.570
animate function here like this with an array.

01:23.700 --> 01:27.120
Now we can pass an array as a second argument to transition

01:27.120 --> 01:31.170
and here we can also define starting

01:31.170 --> 01:34.290
and in-between states during this transition.

01:34.290 --> 01:38.523
So we could pass a style here and say background,

01:39.810 --> 01:43.847
background color shall be orange.

01:45.750 --> 01:46.950
That would be one thing.

01:48.300 --> 01:50.520
Thereafter, the second element in this array

01:50.520 --> 01:52.800
would be an animate function, which takes,

01:52.800 --> 01:56.632
let's say, one second where I wanna animate

01:56.632 --> 02:01.632
my border radius, as before. Border radius, 50 pixels.

02:01.680 --> 02:05.130
And now to avoid this ugly jump at the end,

02:05.130 --> 02:08.010
I add another animate function of half a second

02:08.010 --> 02:10.230
which will be executed after the border radius

02:10.230 --> 02:11.640
has been changed.

02:11.640 --> 02:13.950
Now, with that, we should instantly see a change

02:13.950 --> 02:17.520
to the background color to orange.

02:17.520 --> 02:21.090
Thereafter, we should see the border radios developing

02:21.090 --> 02:23.130
over one second, and thereafter we should

02:23.130 --> 02:26.610
see the animation of, well, half a second,

02:26.610 --> 02:29.820
where we remove the border radius again,

02:29.820 --> 02:33.480
Shrink the object, and turn it from orange

02:33.480 --> 02:36.330
back to our end state, which is green,

02:36.330 --> 02:38.640
for example, if we do shrink it.

02:38.640 --> 02:39.570
Well, let's see this.

02:39.570 --> 02:42.720
If I shrink it, we do indeed see it turn the aura orange,

02:42.720 --> 02:46.020
see the border radius, and thereafter see it shrink

02:46.020 --> 02:47.850
and the border radius being removed.

02:47.850 --> 02:50.250
And the same is true for animate back.

02:50.250 --> 02:53.340
So with that, I got a more complex animation where

02:53.340 --> 02:55.080
I chain multiple styles.

02:55.080 --> 02:57.660
And while all this nesting here might look difficult,

02:57.660 --> 02:59.070
it actually isn't.

02:59.070 --> 03:02.670
It only is an array passed to the transition

03:02.670 --> 03:06.030
which allows us to define different phases

03:06.030 --> 03:07.440
in that transition.

03:07.440 --> 03:10.200
Starting phase, if no animate method is used,

03:10.200 --> 03:12.270
then it is instantly applied.

03:12.270 --> 03:15.780
Then, if we do add animate, we do apply a style,

03:15.780 --> 03:18.570
but over some time, and if we have animate

03:18.570 --> 03:21.240
without a style this means, basically, now

03:21.240 --> 03:24.750
transition to the end state, and this is how we can

03:24.750 --> 03:25.950
set up our animation. Of course,

03:25.950 --> 03:29.190
we could have multiple in-between styles.

03:29.190 --> 03:31.560
The important thing is that you do end

03:31.560 --> 03:34.950
with animate 500, or whatever timing you have,

03:34.950 --> 03:37.020
to get smoothly to the end state.

03:37.020 --> 03:38.910
Otherwise, you will see what we had before

03:38.910 --> 03:41.640
that it instantly snaps back to your end state.

03:41.640 --> 03:44.040
Probably not what you want.

03:44.040 --> 03:49.040
This is a more complex transition with the in-between steps,

03:49.140 --> 03:51.240
but, I think, still manageable if you really

03:51.240 --> 03:52.860
think about what's happening here

03:52.860 --> 03:55.143
with these different phases.
