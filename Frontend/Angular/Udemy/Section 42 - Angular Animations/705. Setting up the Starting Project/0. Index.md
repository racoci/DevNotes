00:02.040 --> 00:03.930
-: In this application you are seeing here,

00:03.930 --> 00:05.700
I get two buttons, Animate! And Shrink!,

00:05.700 --> 00:07.140
and they don't do anything.

00:07.140 --> 00:09.270
I'll come back to these buttons in a second.

00:09.270 --> 00:10.290
And then we got two lists,

00:10.290 --> 00:13.110
and I can add items to the list with the Add button, list,

00:13.110 --> 00:14.580
or the Add Item button here.

00:14.580 --> 00:16.740
I can add it to both lists, actually.

00:16.740 --> 00:18.270
I do have twice the same list

00:18.270 --> 00:21.060
because I wanna show different animations later on.

00:21.060 --> 00:23.400
Let's start with the two buttons up here

00:23.400 --> 00:25.560
and the basics of animations.

00:25.560 --> 00:26.393
As a side note,

00:26.393 --> 00:29.670
this project is, of course, attached to this lecture.

00:29.670 --> 00:32.130
So how do we start with it?

00:32.130 --> 00:36.540
How does the animation system in Angular 2 generally work?

00:36.540 --> 00:38.310
Well, if we have a look at the source code

00:38.310 --> 00:40.470
behind this template here,

00:40.470 --> 00:42.270
we see that here we get the two buttons

00:42.270 --> 00:44.100
and then we get this empty div.

00:44.100 --> 00:46.320
Now, that's the div I wanna animate

00:46.320 --> 00:48.120
and on which I wanna show

00:48.120 --> 00:50.703
how animations in Angular 2 generally work.
