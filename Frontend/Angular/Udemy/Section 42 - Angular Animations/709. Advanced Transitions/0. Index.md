00:01.432 --> 00:02.880
-: Well the first thing you can do,

00:02.880 --> 00:05.220
and for that I'm animating this, or excuse me,

00:05.220 --> 00:07.530
I'm commenting this out.

00:07.530 --> 00:10.020
If you wanted to use the same timing,

00:10.020 --> 00:11.550
you don't have to duplicate this

00:11.550 --> 00:16.500
and simply write highlighted to normal here.

00:16.500 --> 00:18.300
Instead, you can use one line

00:18.300 --> 00:21.180
and simply make an arrow point in both directions.

00:21.180 --> 00:22.950
Now this means back and forth,

00:22.950 --> 00:24.720
use the same animate function.

00:24.720 --> 00:28.020
So in this type of case used to 300 milliseconds

00:28.020 --> 00:30.270
which now means we have the same timing.

00:30.270 --> 00:32.220
That's one thing.

00:32.220 --> 00:35.370
But also, you might have a more complex animation,

00:35.370 --> 00:37.980
where you want to control the styling

00:37.980 --> 00:39.750
this has during the movement.

00:39.750 --> 00:41.880
So not the beginning, and not the end state;

00:41.880 --> 00:44.040
only during the transition.

00:44.040 --> 00:46.230
You might have some extra styles at this place,

00:46.230 --> 00:48.150
or at this point of time too.

00:48.150 --> 00:51.960
Well, to simulate this, let me copy this trigger here

00:51.960 --> 00:54.570
so that we keep the simple one too.

00:54.570 --> 00:56.700
And I will name it wildState

00:56.700 --> 00:58.920
because it's getting more wild now.

00:58.920 --> 01:01.290
So the wildState should now be applied

01:01.290 --> 01:03.030
to a new div I'm copying here,

01:03.030 --> 01:06.690
to which is now bound to that new wildState.

01:06.690 --> 01:10.500
It still uses my state property, don't get me wrong,

01:10.500 --> 01:13.620
but, here it now uses the wildState.

01:13.620 --> 01:15.000
Now with that, I'm binding it

01:15.000 --> 01:17.550
to the wildState animation trigger.

01:17.550 --> 01:19.830
I also want to set up a new property.

01:19.830 --> 01:22.440
I'll name it wildState.

01:22.440 --> 01:27.440
And therefore here in my component I'll duplicate normal

01:27.510 --> 01:30.240
and set this to wildState so that I have two

01:30.240 --> 01:33.003
different divs where we can see two different things.

01:34.080 --> 01:36.240
Now, how does wildState work?

01:36.240 --> 01:38.340
Or how do I want to control this?

01:38.340 --> 01:41.580
Well, I still wanna have my normal and my highlighted style

01:41.580 --> 01:44.010
and I will leave the styling I have here.

01:44.010 --> 01:46.440
But, I wanna set up a third state.

01:46.440 --> 01:49.050
This is the shrunken state, let's say.

01:49.050 --> 01:51.900
So I'm able to shrink this square.

01:51.900 --> 01:55.230
The background color, let's say, should then be green,

01:55.230 --> 01:59.430
and we transform it such that we wanna translate it

01:59.430 --> 02:04.430
100 pixels, but we wanna scale it to 0.5, let's say.

02:08.310 --> 02:11.760
And no, let's actually translate it zero pixels,

02:11.760 --> 02:13.530
so at the starting point.

02:13.530 --> 02:15.270
Therefore, in the other two states

02:15.270 --> 02:16.740
we wanna scale it to one.

02:16.740 --> 02:19.833
So that's again, normal CSS setup here.

02:20.730 --> 02:23.220
And with that we set up the different states.

02:23.220 --> 02:27.840
Now I wanna go back to where the two directions,

02:27.840 --> 02:31.800
highlighted to normal, and normal to highlighted,

02:31.800 --> 02:35.460
have different durations like we had before.

02:35.460 --> 02:36.510
So like this, yeah,

02:36.510 --> 02:39.810
I could've just commented this out anyways.

02:39.810 --> 02:41.790
Now I also wanna adjust this,

02:41.790 --> 02:46.140
and also hook up this on shrink method here,

02:46.140 --> 02:47.970
or this shrink button.

02:47.970 --> 02:52.970
So on shrink, shall now assign this wildState,

02:53.160 --> 02:56.370
to be shrunken.

02:56.370 --> 02:59.973
That is that third state I set up, up here, shrunken.

03:00.840 --> 03:03.420
In onAnimate I therefore also,

03:03.420 --> 03:07.140
wanna set this wildState equal to,

03:07.140 --> 03:10.560
or first compare it if it's equal to normal.

03:10.560 --> 03:13.470
And if not, well I basically wanna do the same as here.

03:13.470 --> 03:16.890
So let me quickly copy this and replace this.

03:16.890 --> 03:19.470
So here I'm not using the shrunken state.

03:19.470 --> 03:21.693
That's something I'm only setting here.

03:23.250 --> 03:28.203
Now with this setup, I can of course reload my application,

03:29.250 --> 03:33.000
and once it does reload we should see a new square,

03:33.000 --> 03:34.290
below the first one.

03:34.290 --> 03:38.280
And maybe let's introduce a little divider here,

03:38.280 --> 03:42.570
like a line break so that we can clearly see the difference.

03:42.570 --> 03:44.940
And now if we click animate, they both move

03:44.940 --> 03:48.390
with different speeds, of course, because I changed this.

03:48.390 --> 03:51.630
But shrinking still happens instantly.

03:51.630 --> 03:54.300
So shrinking is not really animated

03:54.300 --> 03:56.820
and that is something I want to change.

03:56.820 --> 03:58.350
So back in the app component,

03:58.350 --> 04:00.960
we basically need a third transition,

04:00.960 --> 04:02.790
because we're only targeting normal

04:02.790 --> 04:06.540
and highlighted and we're not using shrunken now.

04:06.540 --> 04:09.810
To do that, I can use the following transition,

04:09.810 --> 04:13.440
where I transition from into shrunken,

04:13.440 --> 04:15.060
and now from anywhere.

04:15.060 --> 04:18.720
So I don't care if I have normal or highlighted.

04:18.720 --> 04:21.150
No matter which of the both states it is,

04:21.150 --> 04:23.550
I wanna play the same animation.

04:23.550 --> 04:25.650
And for that I can use the wild card character,

04:25.650 --> 04:27.120
which means any state.

04:27.120 --> 04:31.290
So shrunken to any state and shrunken from any state,

04:31.290 --> 04:33.720
should play the same animation here.

04:33.720 --> 04:36.960
For now, I'll animate it over 500 milliseconds,

04:36.960 --> 04:40.173
so that we can see something before I then fine tune this.

04:41.010 --> 04:44.610
So after reloading this, if I now shrink it,

04:44.610 --> 04:47.670
you see it shrink down and if I animate,

04:47.670 --> 04:52.170
you now see it switch and animate correctly.

04:52.170 --> 04:54.180
So now we are animating this,

04:54.180 --> 04:55.830
and the wild card character here,

04:55.830 --> 04:58.110
is the key to give us flexibility,

04:58.110 --> 05:01.830
that we don't manually have to specify any possible state,

05:01.830 --> 05:03.150
and in our application,

05:03.150 --> 05:05.460
where you maybe derive the state dynamically

05:05.460 --> 05:08.280
you might really not know which states it could have.

05:08.280 --> 05:11.340
And there the wildcard character is what you need.

05:11.340 --> 05:12.183
Now in the next video, I wanna dive in,

05:12.183 --> 05:16.770
how to manipulate this animate function

05:16.770 --> 05:19.923
and have some in between styles during the animation.
