00:01.860 --> 00:03.210
-: Welcome to a new module.

00:03.210 --> 00:04.290
In this course, we had a look

00:04.290 --> 00:07.200
at a lot of functionalities Angular 2 offers us

00:07.200 --> 00:11.370
which allow us to create awesome single page applications.

00:11.370 --> 00:13.950
Now, one functionality we haven't covered yet

00:13.950 --> 00:15.180
and where I also wanna give you

00:15.180 --> 00:18.630
a basic introduction to it at least, are animations.

00:18.630 --> 00:21.030
Angular 2 ships with its own animation system

00:21.030 --> 00:22.890
which we can use to, for example,

00:22.890 --> 00:25.320
render the addition of items to a list

00:25.320 --> 00:27.570
or the conditional attaching

00:27.570 --> 00:29.850
or detaching of elements to the DOM.

00:29.850 --> 00:32.940
So all these things which are kind of hard to handle

00:32.940 --> 00:35.880
with normal CSS transitions or animations

00:35.880 --> 00:37.830
because if you add something to the DOM

00:37.830 --> 00:39.360
which isn't there before,

00:39.360 --> 00:43.260
it's hard to handle this with a CSS transition style.

00:43.260 --> 00:44.940
Therefore, in this module, we'll have a look

00:44.940 --> 00:47.190
at the tools Angular 2 offers us

00:47.190 --> 00:50.910
to turn this application here, which isn't too awesome,

00:50.910 --> 00:52.920
but which has a list at least,

00:52.920 --> 00:55.980
well to turn this into a nicer application

00:55.980 --> 00:58.470
where we play around with a couple of animations

00:58.470 --> 01:01.203
and see how the animation system in Angular 2 works.
