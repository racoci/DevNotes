00:01.320 --> 00:03.630
-: So we're able to hard switch between states.

00:03.630 --> 00:04.860
Now let's animate it.

00:04.860 --> 00:07.380
In our animations' trigger, on the same level

00:07.380 --> 00:12.380
as the state method, implement the transition method.

00:12.690 --> 00:15.663
This also needs to be imported from at angular core.

00:16.939 --> 00:20.040
Now, transition is a very intuitive method.

00:20.040 --> 00:23.550
It allows us to describe how the transition

00:23.550 --> 00:26.160
from one state to another state should look

00:26.160 --> 00:28.470
like or should work, how it should be animated.

00:28.470 --> 00:30.900
Therefore, transition, as a first argument,

00:30.900 --> 00:34.590
expects the starting state, then an arrow pointing

00:34.590 --> 00:38.070
or indicating the direction, and then highlighted here.

00:38.070 --> 00:41.220
So this means from normal to highlighted.

00:41.220 --> 00:42.540
Well, now what?

00:42.540 --> 00:44.580
Well, now in the second argument, too,

00:44.580 --> 00:46.350
we specify what to do.

00:46.350 --> 00:48.960
We specify animate which all needs

00:48.960 --> 00:51.120
to be imported from at angular cord.

00:51.120 --> 00:54.240
So now for this direction, from normal to highlighted,

00:54.240 --> 00:56.460
we now set up how to animate this.

00:56.460 --> 00:59.610
And the easiest way is to simply pass a number here,

00:59.610 --> 01:02.400
the number of milliseconds it should simply take.

01:02.400 --> 01:04.620
I'll also come to more advanced use cases

01:04.620 --> 01:07.770
where we can also have some in between styles

01:07.770 --> 01:09.480
during the animation.

01:09.480 --> 01:12.480
Well, before coming to so advanced topics,

01:12.480 --> 01:15.780
let me also copy it, and let's change the timing,

01:15.780 --> 01:18.630
so that we can see a difference for the other way around.

01:18.630 --> 01:23.630
So highlight it to normal like this.

01:24.000 --> 01:25.683
And if we now save this,

01:28.140 --> 01:32.640
we see that now it moves, and it moves slower back.

01:32.640 --> 01:35.550
And this is now our first animation

01:35.550 --> 01:40.170
using the angular to animation framework or helpers

01:40.170 --> 01:44.010
here with that trigger, the different states,

01:44.010 --> 01:46.620
and then the transitions between these states.

01:46.620 --> 01:48.630
Now let's dive a little bit deeper at this,

01:48.630 --> 01:50.430
and see how we can fine tune this

01:50.430 --> 01:52.503
to our needs in the next videos.
