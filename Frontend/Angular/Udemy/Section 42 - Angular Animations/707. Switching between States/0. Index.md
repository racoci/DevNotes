00:01.410 --> 00:04.200
-: Right now in our application, we are at the place

00:04.200 --> 00:08.610
that we are able to display one state, normal here.

00:08.610 --> 00:11.940
Or of course, if I were to change this to "highlighted"

00:11.940 --> 00:14.580
and related recompile, this should get blue

00:14.580 --> 00:17.460
and move to the right, like this.

00:17.460 --> 00:20.040
But now we want to animate the transition

00:20.040 --> 00:22.170
between both states.

00:22.170 --> 00:23.820
Now with that set back to "normal,"

00:23.820 --> 00:25.770
right now we have no way to move

00:25.770 --> 00:28.110
or change the state from our code.

00:28.110 --> 00:30.780
But we do have this animate button

00:30.780 --> 00:34.290
and we try to execute it on animate method there.

00:34.290 --> 00:37.443
So let's hook up the on animate method here.

00:38.390 --> 00:40.800
"onAnimate" and what do we want to do in this

00:40.800 --> 00:44.550
on animate method, I simply want to switch to state.

00:44.550 --> 00:48.147
So here I wanna check if this state "== 'normal'"

00:49.170 --> 00:54.170
then I want to set "this.state = to 'highlighted'",

00:57.600 --> 01:02.600
otherwise, I want to set "this.state = 'normal'".

01:03.000 --> 01:05.463
Now with this in place, if I save this,

01:06.840 --> 01:09.300
let the application reload.

01:09.300 --> 01:11.940
Now you see, it's gone.

01:11.940 --> 01:13.350
Well, that's simply a bug,

01:13.350 --> 01:15.900
because I'm using background color as a string,

01:15.900 --> 01:18.630
and then like this here, we actually have to use

01:18.630 --> 01:20.940
the very same and I think this should get fixed,

01:20.940 --> 01:21.870
to be honest.

01:21.870 --> 01:24.000
Just wanted to bring this to your awareness,

01:24.000 --> 01:26.640
if you're mixing the way you are setting up your properties,

01:26.640 --> 01:29.790
even though it should theoretically work, it doesn't.

01:29.790 --> 01:32.550
Make sure it use the same type of property name.

01:32.550 --> 01:35.070
But if I switch this, and I now have the function

01:35.070 --> 01:37.650
to change my state, you can now see I can switch

01:37.650 --> 01:40.590
between both stage and toggle between them.

01:40.590 --> 01:43.410
But now, we wanna animate the transition,

01:43.410 --> 01:46.200
so that we now instantly switch the state,

01:46.200 --> 01:48.300
as we already are able to deal with that.

01:48.300 --> 01:50.520
But now that we animate this,

01:50.520 --> 01:52.830
otherwise we wouldn't need this animation trigger here

01:52.830 --> 01:56.118
at all, because just appending different styles,

01:56.118 --> 01:59.040
well that's something we'll learn throughout the course.

01:59.040 --> 02:02.043
So next, let's have a look at implementing this transition.
