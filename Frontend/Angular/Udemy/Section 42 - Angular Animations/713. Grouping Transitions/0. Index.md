00:01.680 --> 00:04.320
Instructor: Now for animating an item out,

00:04.320 --> 00:07.080
let's say we wanted to have two different animations

00:07.080 --> 00:10.170
which take a different amount of time.

00:10.170 --> 00:13.140
So two different animations would be rather easy.

00:13.140 --> 00:15.445
Here is where we animate out

00:15.445 --> 00:18.397
and we're having this style being set

00:18.397 --> 00:20.885
up during the animate function

00:20.885 --> 00:24.180
and if we now want to have a second style

00:24.180 --> 00:27.660
we could add a new animate function here

00:27.660 --> 00:32.224
and let's say here we simply want to change the text color

00:32.224 --> 00:34.560
to red.

00:34.560 --> 00:36.660
Now if we save this let's see what happens

00:36.660 --> 00:39.693
if I do animate out an item on the bottom list.

00:40.920 --> 00:42.699
If I click on milk,

00:42.699 --> 00:47.699
well it's invisible before I see the color turn to red.

00:48.150 --> 00:50.190
That is not really optimal.

00:50.190 --> 00:54.930
So if I switch the order here so that I at least see this

00:54.930 --> 00:57.430
let's see if it at least works how it should work.

00:58.470 --> 01:01.650
If I click an item, it gets red and that is animated out.

01:01.650 --> 01:04.440
But what if I wanted to have both at the same time

01:04.440 --> 01:07.230
but maybe with different timings so that I don't wait

01:07.230 --> 01:10.263
for one animation to finish before starting the next.

01:11.160 --> 01:16.160
I can do this by passing or by using the group method.

01:16.260 --> 01:18.240
That's all the method to be imported

01:18.240 --> 01:22.230
by angular two or from angular core I mean, yeah.

01:22.230 --> 01:26.430
So from angular core and in this group method here

01:26.430 --> 01:29.940
as an argument we pass an array of animations

01:29.940 --> 01:31.830
we wanna perform synchronously.

01:31.830 --> 01:34.050
So at the same time.

01:34.050 --> 01:37.350
So here I can now pass my two animate methods

01:37.350 --> 01:39.690
and I'll give it different durations so

01:39.690 --> 01:42.690
that we can clearly see that both happens at the same time

01:42.690 --> 01:44.670
and now if I save this

01:44.670 --> 01:47.820
and we let it reload, let's remove an item.

01:47.820 --> 01:48.720
You see,

01:48.720 --> 01:50.760
it turns red while it's moving

01:50.760 --> 01:54.540
but it moves slower than it takes to turn it red,

01:54.540 --> 01:57.030
and this is how we can use animation group to

01:57.030 --> 01:58.440
group multiple animations

01:58.440 --> 02:01.440
with possibly different timings together to have them

02:01.440 --> 02:04.800
happen at the same time and animate different things

02:04.800 --> 02:09.033
over as you here, possibly different durations.
