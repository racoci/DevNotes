00:01.410 --> 00:02.370
-: So that's all nice.

00:02.370 --> 00:05.094
We're able to animate these diffs here, but what

00:05.094 --> 00:09.090
if we actually do want to animate the addition

00:09.090 --> 00:10.194
of an item to the list?

00:10.194 --> 00:12.089
Or if I click on it there remove them,

00:12.089 --> 00:14.400
re movement of such an item.

00:14.400 --> 00:16.050
How can we animate this?

00:16.050 --> 00:17.488
We'll have a look at this now.

00:17.488 --> 00:20.280
Thus far we only animated the diff.

00:20.280 --> 00:24.107
Well, now it's time to add a new trigger to our application.

00:24.107 --> 00:25.981
So I'll copy the first trigger

00:25.981 --> 00:28.345
in this overall animations array here,

00:28.345 --> 00:30.431
this one here, and add it.

00:30.431 --> 00:33.330
Make sure to pick the right level where you add it.

00:33.330 --> 00:34.290
Should be on the same level

00:34.290 --> 00:36.076
as the average triggers, of course.

00:36.076 --> 00:39.600
Now I'm going to name this list 1,

00:39.600 --> 00:41.490
and there I only want to have one state

00:41.490 --> 00:46.490
actually, the in state so that the element is

00:46.680 --> 00:50.430
on the dom is added to the state, it's in the dom.

00:50.430 --> 00:52.680
The our state would be that we don't have the element

00:52.680 --> 00:55.710
because we just removed it or we just added it.

00:55.710 --> 00:58.860
So it kind of should appear.

00:58.860 --> 00:59.693
And that is,

00:59.693 --> 01:02.370
as state handled by Angular tool, as you will learn.

01:02.370 --> 01:04.980
So the instate is how should it look

01:04.980 --> 01:07.088
like once it finally is there?

01:07.088 --> 01:09.720
Well, I wanted to have translate acts

01:09.720 --> 01:11.340
of zero to be at the position.

01:11.340 --> 01:15.240
I actually place it here in my, my HTML code.

01:15.240 --> 01:18.850
And I wanted to have, let's say an opacity

01:20.160 --> 01:24.450
of one so that it is fully visible, not transparent.

01:24.450 --> 01:26.460
That is the one state I have here.

01:26.460 --> 01:28.323
Now I need transitions.

01:29.370 --> 01:31.830
The first transition, which is interesting

01:31.830 --> 01:33.510
for me is when it comes in.

01:33.510 --> 01:37.500
So when I add it to the dom here, the in state is in.

01:37.500 --> 01:39.810
But what is the beginning state?

01:39.810 --> 01:42.270
Well, we could use the wild card character,

01:42.270 --> 01:45.360
but there is a specific state for this case

01:45.360 --> 01:49.590
that a element hasn't been added yet, that's void.

01:49.590 --> 01:51.960
So void is a reserved state name.

01:51.960 --> 01:52.800
You can't use it.

01:52.800 --> 01:54.270
You shouldn't override it.

01:54.270 --> 01:56.696
Void is provided by you of four cases

01:56.696 --> 02:00.570
where you do have an element in an end state

02:00.570 --> 02:03.273
which wasn't added to the dom at the beginning.

02:03.273 --> 02:05.490
Or of course you could also add void

02:05.490 --> 02:07.110
as the transition to state.

02:07.110 --> 02:09.791
So if you remove a element for example.

02:09.791 --> 02:14.791
With this, it should slowly appear, and we can see this

02:14.970 --> 02:19.440
in action by going to our app component to our HTML file.

02:19.440 --> 02:23.370
And there on the list, on the list item specifically

02:23.370 --> 02:24.480
we want to add a trigger

02:24.480 --> 02:28.890
as before, square brackets, and then at, and then list one.

02:28.890 --> 02:30.945
And we don't need to bind it to anything

02:30.945 --> 02:35.945
because I will actually set up void to anything

02:36.150 --> 02:39.870
because I don't care what the specific state is in.

02:39.870 --> 02:41.100
It's just a dummy here.

02:41.100 --> 02:43.980
You could use any name I only have in here.

02:43.980 --> 02:45.360
We could have some logic in the code

02:45.360 --> 02:48.000
which changes the state of our list items.

02:48.000 --> 02:51.720
But here for the entering animation, when we add a new item,

02:51.720 --> 02:54.390
I don't care what the initial state is.

02:54.390 --> 02:56.550
And actually I never said it in this application.

02:56.550 --> 02:59.106
I never apply a state of in to this.

02:59.106 --> 03:02.670
I don't have a property managing my list element states.

03:02.670 --> 03:06.210
I do have it for the above examples, but here I don't care.

03:06.210 --> 03:11.210
I want to animate from non-existent to any state.

03:11.357 --> 03:14.100
This is the animation I want to execute.

03:14.100 --> 03:15.840
And if I save this

03:15.840 --> 03:20.840
and we see this in action, let's add Test here.

03:23.010 --> 03:25.710
And well, that is certainly not working as intended.

03:25.710 --> 03:27.390
So what's going wrong here?

03:27.390 --> 03:30.300
Well, the issue is clearly we have no starting state.

03:30.300 --> 03:32.772
Now it doesn't work such that we now set

03:32.772 --> 03:37.080
up void like this before we define our states like this.

03:37.080 --> 03:39.390
But since void is kind of a built instate

03:39.390 --> 03:41.370
it now works differently.

03:41.370 --> 03:45.457
Instead here in our transition we now want to change this.

03:45.457 --> 03:50.040
We will use an array here where animate is placed in.

03:50.040 --> 03:54.600
But before executing animate, I will have a number

03:54.600 --> 03:57.270
style method where I set an initial style.

03:57.270 --> 03:58.594
And this style will now be applied

03:58.594 --> 04:01.230
by Angular tool right at the beginning.

04:01.230 --> 04:03.960
So when we add a new list item, it is appended

04:03.960 --> 04:06.969
to the dom and it will instantly get this style

04:06.969 --> 04:09.900
by Angular tool and then transition

04:09.900 --> 04:14.220
over this duration to its final style here.

04:14.220 --> 04:16.080
So the style I want to set up here

04:16.080 --> 04:18.498
therefore is a opacity of zero.

04:18.498 --> 04:21.738
And I want to transform such that it flies in.

04:21.738 --> 04:25.109
So translateX should be minus 100 pixels.

04:25.109 --> 04:27.780
And now if I save this, now

04:27.780 --> 04:30.570
we should see a nice animation when I actually

04:30.570 --> 04:32.784
add new items to the list here.

04:32.784 --> 04:35.610
You saw it up on the initial loading already

04:35.610 --> 04:39.000
and now each new item is smoothly animated

04:39.000 --> 04:41.820
in like that automatically by Angular tool.

04:41.820 --> 04:43.860
It doesn't work for deleting though.

04:43.860 --> 04:45.570
So let's handle this next.

04:45.570 --> 04:46.980
Well, let's say for deleting

04:46.980 --> 04:49.203
we want to have it fly to the right.

04:50.070 --> 04:55.000
So to do this, I'll add a new transition here to my trigger.

04:56.650 --> 05:01.650
And here I want to navigate or animate from any state

05:03.480 --> 05:07.140
to any state would be possible to, but to wide specifically.

05:07.140 --> 05:12.140
And here I want to start with the state it already has.

05:12.480 --> 05:14.922
So, no need to define a starting state.

05:14.922 --> 05:19.260
Instead, my animate function should now have a final state

05:19.260 --> 05:21.180
because here I don't have the problem

05:21.180 --> 05:23.970
of it snapping to some other state at the end.

05:23.970 --> 05:26.580
This should be the state it takes at the end.

05:26.580 --> 05:28.860
So here with style as the second argument

05:28.860 --> 05:31.950
as you learn it above here, I set up the state.

05:31.950 --> 05:35.340
I want to have it where I want to have it at the end.

05:35.340 --> 05:38.913
And there I want to transform to translatex

05:38.913 --> 05:43.740
plus 100 pixels to move it to the right and to all the faded

05:43.740 --> 05:47.607
out by setting the opacity to zero again.

05:47.607 --> 05:50.263
Well, and with that in place, the timing, yeah, let's

05:50.263 --> 05:53.280
let's have it at 302.

05:53.280 --> 05:56.400
Once it reloads and I click on the element, you see it

05:56.400 --> 05:59.640
smoothly transition out and being removed.

05:59.640 --> 06:02.400
And this is how you can animate lists.

06:02.400 --> 06:05.040
And the same would of course all the work for NGF

06:05.040 --> 06:06.330
where you also have that behavior

06:06.330 --> 06:08.853
of something new being added to the dom.
