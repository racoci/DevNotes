Further Resources & Where to Go Next

This Module **only provides a brief and basic Introduction** to Angular Unit Tests and the Angular Testing Suite. This Course isn't focused on Testing.

If you want to dive deeper, the **official Docs** actually are a great place to start. There you'll also find a **Non-CLI Setup**!

**Official Docs**: [https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/testing.html](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/testing.html)

I can also recommend the following Article: [https://semaphoreci.com/community/tutorials/testing-components-in-angular-2-with-jasmine](https://semaphoreci.com/community/tutorials/testing-components-in-angular-2-with-jasmine)

For **more Information on how to run Tests with the CLI** have a look at their official Docs:
