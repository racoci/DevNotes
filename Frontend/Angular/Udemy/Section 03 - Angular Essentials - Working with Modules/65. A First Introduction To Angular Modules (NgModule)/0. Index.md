00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:01.860
<v Instructor>Now to explore</v>

2
00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:04.500
the concept of Angular modules,

3
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.740
I am back in that essentials application

4
00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.030
we worked on in the last course section.

5
00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.670
So it's the same application.

6
00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.190
You find a snapshot attached,

7
00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.520
and I can of course start this application

8
00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.120
after installing the dependencies with NPM install.

9
00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:27.210
And I then get this app we worked on

10
00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.103
in the previous section.

11
00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.780
And now I wanna migrate this application

12
00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.780
to use Angular modules, instead of Standalone Components.

13
00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.110
So what's the idea behind Angular modules?

14
00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.040
Well, as I mentioned,

15
00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.270
it's a feature that mostly exists for historic reasons,

16
00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.600
though you can absolutely still use it today,

17
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.320
if you, for example, prefer it over Standalone Components,

18
00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.930
or if you are working on some project

19
00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.120
that simply uses modules

20
00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.030
because it may be always used modules,

21
00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.870
or because it's using an older version of Angular.

22
00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:10.710
And the idea behind Angular modules

23
00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.010
in the end is that you don't specify

24
00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.320
on a per component level

25
00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.260
as you do it with Standalone Components,

26
00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:23.190
which Components that component uses in its template.

27
00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:26.520
So for example, with Standalone Components,

28
00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.640
if my app component in its template

29
00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.810
uses my custom header component and the user component

30
00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.000
and the tasks component,

31
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000
I have to specify these Components in this imports array

32
00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.810
of the app component,

33
00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.080
if I'm dealing with Standalone Components.

34
00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:49.740
And instead of doing that on a per component level

35
00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.640
with modules, you instead create a module

36
00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.180
that simply combines all the Components

37
00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.580
that need to work with each other.

38
00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:01.050
You could say,

39
00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:04.080
so that your component decorators

40
00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.230
and the configuration you pass to your Components

41
00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:09.480
gets leaner because you don't need

42
00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:11.790
this imports array, for example,

43
00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.250
when working with Angular modules,

44
00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.880
but you instead have those extra modules.

45
00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.950
The downside of this approach

46
00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.690
is that whilst the component decorators get a bit leaner,

47
00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:27.180
it's not immediately obvious

48
00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.390
which component uses which other components.

49
00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.050
And you have to create those extra modules,

50
00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.320
which is not necessarily an advantage.

51
00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.170
But let's not waste too much time here,

52
00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.250
instead, let's simply migrate this essentials project here

53
00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.200
to use Angular modules.

54
00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.020
And along the way, you'll therefore learn how to work

55
00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:51.420
with those modules, how to create them,

56
00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:54.990
and how they differ from Standalone Components.

57
00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:56.640
Though I also wanna mention

58
00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.820
that you can mix and match Standalone Components

59
00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:01.680
and modules if you wanted to,

60
00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.933
but you'll also see that in action soon.
