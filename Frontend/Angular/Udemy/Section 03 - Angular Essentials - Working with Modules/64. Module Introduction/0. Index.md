00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:04.350
<v Maximilian>So at this point you did learn a lot</v>

2
00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.160
about crucial Angular essentials,

3
00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.000
and you did learn how to build Angular applications,

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.730
at least basic applications.

5
00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.630
And, of course, we're going to dive deeper into Angular

6
00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.890
and into more advanced features throughout this course.

7
00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.370
However, when we explored

8
00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:31.020
those essentials in the previous sections,

9
00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:35.370
we worked with, so-called standalone components,

10
00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.710
which is just one kind

11
00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.440
of components you can build in Angular apps.

12
00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.610
And even though it's the nowadays recommended

13
00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.950
way of building Angular Components,

14
00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.260
and it's the most modern way

15
00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.420
of building Angular components,

16
00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.970
and of combining components,

17
00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:57.030
there also exists an alternative,

18
00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.030
because you can also use so-called Angular modules

19
00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:05.280
for grouping components together

20
00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.223
and for structuring your application.

21
00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.450
And this feature exists mostly for historic reasons,

22
00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:16.290
because in the past

23
00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.290
and also when Angular Two was released in 2016,

24
00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.630
Angular modules were the only way

25
00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.090
of building Angular apps

26
00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.060
or of combining Angular Components,

27
00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.240
and therefore a lot of projects still used this approach.

28
00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.850
And therefore, in this section,

29
00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.230
you will learn what exactly Angular modules are

30
00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:42.600
and how you can create and use them,

31
00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.050
and how you can use them to combine components

32
00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:49.800
instead of using standalone components.

33
00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.260
You will learn how to declare

34
00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.680
and export components in modules

35
00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.170
and why you would want to do that,

36
00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.250
and you will learn how to combine multiple modules

37
00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.130
and how to share module functionalities.

38
00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.400
Though this will all, of course, make more sense

39
00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:12.480
once you understand what exactly Angular modules are.

40
00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.043
So let's dive into that.
