00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.010
<v Maximilian>So back in this project,</v>

2
00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:04.290
let's now create such a module.

3
00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.250
And what you typically do in every Angular app

4
00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.040
that uses Angular modules

5
00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.520
is that you create a root AppModule,

6
00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:18.450
typically next to the root AppComponent.

7
00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:21.330
So here next to the app.component.ts file,

8
00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.173
I create a app.module.ts file.

9
00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.620
Again, following that naming convention

10
00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:31.530
you've seen over and over again throughout the course

11
00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:34.140
where the file name contains a description

12
00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.960
of what's inside that file.

13
00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.673
In this case, a module.

14
00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:44.010
Well then, a module as so often in Angular

15
00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.370
is just a class that gets exported.

16
00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.780
And as components or services, the name of the class

17
00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.690
should have an identifier like app,

18
00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.170
if it's the main app root module,

19
00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.386
and then a description of what exactly this class is about.

20
00:01:01.386 --> 00:01:04.170
And in this case, it will be a module.

21
00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.177
So, the name would be AppModule.

22
00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.090
Again, not for technical reasons,

23
00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.920
you could name it whatever you want,

24
00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.463
but that's the convention you typically see in Angular.

25
00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.130
Well, and then also, as you often see it in Angular,

26
00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.930
you decorate this class with a special decorator,

27
00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.930
and that special decorator is imported from @angular/core,

28
00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.073
and it's the NgModule decorator that must be imported here.

29
00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.593
And that's then added with that @ symbol to this class.

30
00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.830
Now, like most decorators,

31
00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:47.040
this decorator takes a configuration object

32
00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.470
where you now configure this module.

33
00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.410
Because I mentioned that modules would be the things

34
00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:56.220
you set up to group Components together.

35
00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:00.049
So, one essential configuration that must be done

36
00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:03.630
with help of that module is that you add

37
00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.630
a declarations array to its configuration,

38
00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:13.380
because it's that array where you will declare

39
00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.400
and register all the components, for example,

40
00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.250
that need to work together.

41
00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:21.474
I'm saying for example,

42
00:02:21.474 --> 00:02:24.450
because you could also add directives here,

43
00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.810
but we will learn more about directives later in the course.

44
00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.303
So, for now it's Components we wanna focus on.

45
00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:33.630
Well, and which Components

46
00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:37.290
do wanna work together in our app?

47
00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.770
Well, essentially all Components.

48
00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:42.987
Now, for more complex applications,

49
00:02:42.987 --> 00:02:46.560
you could create multiple modules that work together,

50
00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.130
and we'll do that a little bit later in this section.

51
00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:54.153
But for a start, let's start with all Components here.
