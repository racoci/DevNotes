00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:01.920
<v Maximilian>So at this point,</v>

2
00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.280
you learned how to create an Angular module,

3
00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:08.250
how to bootstrap your Angular application

4
00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.260
with such a module,

5
00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.620
how to register non-Standalone Components,

6
00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.870
how to register other modules

7
00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.200
and merge them into this module, so to say,

8
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.530
and how to register Standalone Components

9
00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:24.330
so that you can build applications

10
00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.823
that use both kinds of Components.

11
00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:30.270
It's also worth mentioning here

12
00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:33.750
that those Standalone Components, on the other hand,

13
00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.000
also can use modules.

14
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.750
So you can not just add Standalone Components to modules,

15
00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.410
but also modules to Standalone Components.

16
00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.200
And we're actually already doing that here

17
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.593
in our application in the new task component.

18
00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.800
There, we have a Standalone Component,

19
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.840
and in its imports array,

20
00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.380
we're not importing some other kind of component,

21
00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:01.740
but instead, a module, the FormsModule

22
00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:04.053
that is provided by Angular.

23
00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:08.700
And that FormsModule is such a NgModule

24
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.460
that has been built by the Angular team,

25
00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.240
and that provides a collection of Directives

26
00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.630
and generally features we might wanna use

27
00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.550
in our application.

28
00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:24.030
And we can easily use that in a Standalone Component

29
00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.630
by adding it to this imports array like this.

30
00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.100
That's nothing new.

31
00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.250
We did that in the previous section already,

32
00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.620
but it's important to keep that in mind

33
00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:39.060
and understand that you can mix and match

34
00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.160
non-Standalone Components,

35
00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:45.060
and Standalone Components just as needed,

36
00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.790
which is important because this, for example,

37
00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.790
also simplifies the process of migrating an Angular app

38
00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.050
from Standalone Components

39
00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:58.530
to modules or vice versa.

40
00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.480
And speaking of migration,

41
00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.420
we're also going to continue with one here,

42
00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.660
and we're going to continue to migrate

43
00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:09.840
this entire first demo app we built here

44
00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.963
from Standalone Components to modules.
