<v ->So the effort to get started with this section,</v>

2
00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.720
let's start with probably the most important question.

3
00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:12.270
What is NgRx?

4
00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:16.710
And the answer is, it's a state management solution.

5
00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.810
It's a package you can install

6
00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.770
into your Angular projects to get some help

7
00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:26.160
with managing your application-wide state

8
00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.280
because that's what this NgRx package

9
00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:31.080
and library is all about.

10
00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.810
It aims to help you with the management

11
00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:38.430
of typically more complex application-wide state.

12
00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.210
And state simply is data that's used

13
00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.600
in one or more components in your application,

14
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.720
that typically changes over time, for example,

15
00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:50.850
because the user clicked a button.

16
00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.450
And where those data changes should then lead to

17
00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:59.310
a change in the application, typically to a UI update.

18
00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:02.250
And of course, in this course you already managed

19
00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.700
a lot of state either directly in a component

20
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.530
by simply storing some data

21
00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.110
in a property that then got changed

22
00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.480
as a button was clicked, for example.

23
00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:15.960
Or if you needed data in multiple components

24
00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.620
with help of a service where you stored some data

25
00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:22.590
in a service, changed it from component A,

26
00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.400
and then maybe used it in component B, for example,

27
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.120
with help of a behavior subject or something like this.

28
00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:32.700
So you already learned about state management

29
00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.630
and NgRx is simply a never solution you could use

30
00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.900
instead of storing and managing your state

31
00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.080
directly inside of components or services.

32
00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:46.560
And the data for it is a totally optional solution.

33
00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.280
It's an alternative, not something you have to use,

34
00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.930
but something you might want to use

35
00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.880
in more complex applications,

36
00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.150
since, as you will learn in this section,

37
00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:01.200
NgRx gives you a certain standardized,

38
00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.390
clearly defined approach

39
00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.993
and way of managing application state.
