1
00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:03.240
<v Maximilian>So that's now it</v>

2
00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.960
for this introduction to NgRx.

3
00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.290
You now learned about all these core building blocks

4
00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.470
that are required when working with NgRx.

5
00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:15.900
You also learned about NgRx effects,

6
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.480
and you're therefore now able to use

7
00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.800
this state management solution in your Angular applications,

8
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.590
instead of storing your state with help

9
00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.260
of services or components, which,

10
00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.430
and that's really important, is not wrong or bad,

11
00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.130
but for more complex applications,

12
00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.520
applications that are way more complex than this demo app,

13
00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.820
which I used for introducing you to NgRx,

14
00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.580
using a solution like NgRx

15
00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:47.160
can make your code more manageable

16
00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.013
and a bit easier to understand in the end.

17
00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.780
Now, in this section here, there's still a lot of content

18
00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.250
to come though, because I originally recorded this section

19
00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.500
with an older version of NgRx,

20
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.980
and I used this recipe book project,

21
00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:08.460
which we built in this course to implement NgRx

22
00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.590
and to teach you NgRx.

23
00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.600
Therefore, the rest of this section

24
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.290
uses this slightly older version of NgRx,

25
00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.590
but you can still use the shown code there.

26
00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.620
Because all the things I teach you in this section,

27
00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:24.510
in the remainder of this section,

28
00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:28.260
still apply, and all my explanations still make sense,

29
00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:33.260
hopefully, but I'm not using createReducer or createAction,

30
00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.380
but instead, I'm creating the actions

31
00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.050
as I showed it to you a couple of lectures ago,

32
00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:42.930
and I'm creating the reducers as I showed it to you

33
00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.520
a couple of lectures ago.

34
00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.560
And I'm creating my effects with help

35
00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.430
of this @Effect decorator, which is not supported anymore,

36
00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.313
where you should switch to createEffect instead.

37
00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.840
Nonetheless, I did not delete these old lectures,

38
00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.210
because they might still be valuable to you.

39
00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.910
They do show you NgRx in the context

40
00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:05.520
of this recipe book app after all,

41
00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.020
and I also made sure to attach multiple code snapshots

42
00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.230
to different lectures, which I did also update

43
00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.870
to a more recent version of NgRx,

44
00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.000
so that it should be easy for you

45
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.750
to also follow along with that latest version of NgRx

46
00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.790
by simply using these attached code snapshots,

47
00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:28.233
which you find on some of those later lectures.

48
00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.030
Therefore, you can of course ignore the rest of this section

49
00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:37.080
because you already did get an introduction to NgRx now,

50
00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.270
but if you wanna see it in action

51
00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:41.250
on a slightly bigger project,

52
00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.980
I would recommend that you do follow along,

53
00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.620
maybe at double speed, because of course

54
00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.450
I will also explain some things

55
00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.160
about which you already learned.

56
00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.560
But I would recommend that you still take this

57
00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.710
as an extra exercise and practice,

58
00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:58.380
and as some extra content that still might

59
00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:59.943
be interesting to go through.
