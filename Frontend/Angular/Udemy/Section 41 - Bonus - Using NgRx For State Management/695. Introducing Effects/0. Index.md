00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:04.530
<v Maximilian>Now with selectors out of the way,</v>

2
00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:07.530
we now really got all these core building blocks

3
00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:11.310
you should know about when working with NgRx store,

4
00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:14.459
because now you learned about Reducers and actions,

5
00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:17.040
including that alternative syntax

6
00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:18.660
which you can use for both.

7
00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.751
And you learned about selectors.

8
00:00:20.751 --> 00:00:24.600
Now I wanna really conclude this introduction

9
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.740
by also taking a look at effects, side effects,

10
00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.313
what they are and how NgRx can help you with those.

11
00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:35.970
So let's start with the obvious first question.

12
00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:39.750
What exactly is an effect or a side effect,

13
00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.340
as is also called.

14
00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.624
And in an Angular app in the context of using NgRx,

15
00:00:45.624 --> 00:00:49.050
a side effect typically is anything

16
00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.610
that's not directly related to an immediate UI update.

17
00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.210
So for example, if you change the counter value by one end

18
00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.760
the UI therefore gets updated right away

19
00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.500
to reflect that new value, you have no side effect.

20
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.120
But you could, for example,

21
00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.190
also be sending an HTTP request

22
00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:11.520
or maybe store some data in the browser or local storage,

23
00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.340
or maybe just log something to the console

24
00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.412
and all these things would then be side effects.

25
00:01:18.412 --> 00:01:22.671
Now, why is it important to be aware of such side effects?

26
00:01:22.671 --> 00:01:24.441
Well, because for example,

27
00:01:24.441 --> 00:01:28.200
you should avoid them in your Reducers.

28
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.130
Most importantly, your Reducer state changing functions

29
00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.733
must always be synchronous.

30
00:01:34.733 --> 00:01:37.530
So sending an HTTP request in there

31
00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.100
is absolutely not something you should do.

32
00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.480
You should also not use promises or async await in there.

33
00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:49.110
Instead, these should all be pure synchronous functions.

34
00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.260
You should also not console log in them,

35
00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:56.340
though of course, no horrible things will happen if you do.

36
00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.750
But you should absolutely avoid sending HTTP requests

37
00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.930
reaching out to local storage and things like that.

38
00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:08.160
You should keep these Reducer functions clean and simple

39
00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.410
and focused on their core job,

40
00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.010
which is to produce a new state value.

41
00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:15.750
But of course, it is quite common

42
00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.527
that when a certain action is dispatched

43
00:02:17.527 --> 00:02:21.111
you maybe also do want to log to the console

44
00:02:21.111 --> 00:02:26.111
or send an HTTP request or store something in local storage

45
00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.500
or get something from local storage.

46
00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.860
All these are totally normal things to happen

47
00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.390
and that's why we'll now explore

48
00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.233
how you can handle such side effects with NgRx.
