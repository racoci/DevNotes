00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:05.700
<v Instructor>So NgRx is a state management solution,</v>

2
00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.480
a library that helps with managing state data

3
00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:10.740
in your application

4
00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.820
and a library that gives you a clearly defined way

5
00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.580
of managing application state.

6
00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.540
And that clearly defined approach

7
00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:25.320
all starts with creating a store.

8
00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.320
So once you have NgRx installed into your Angular project,

9
00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.150
something we'll do in the next lectures of course,

10
00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:37.590
you can, and you should, create a store, a data store,

11
00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.470
a state store with NgRx,

12
00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:43.080
because that is where your data will be stored

13
00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:45.840
and managed by NgRx.

14
00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.490
And that's also the place

15
00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:52.320
to which your Components can reach out to to read that data.

16
00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.320
So if a Component needs a certain piece of state,

17
00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.940
if it needs some data,

18
00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.060
and if it should update when that data changes,

19
00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:02.880
it can read that data from that store

20
00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:05.730
and it can listen to data changes

21
00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:08.640
so that Angular can update the UI

22
00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.390
as that data in that store changes.

23
00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.610
And for reading that data,

24
00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.250
and extracting that data from the store,

25
00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.090
it can also leverage a concept called Selectors

26
00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.620
which is a concept defined and introduced by NgRx.

27
00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:28.620
And it's actually a totally optional thing

28
00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:30.450
as you will learn in this section here.

29
00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.330
And therefore, with help of this store

30
00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.210
and these optional Selectors,

31
00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.210
Components can get that globally managed state data.

32
00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.990
With NgRx, you have that one central store

33
00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.970
in your application that in the end

34
00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.870
manages all the data used in your entire application

35
00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:54.630
and your different Components can then get

36
00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.690
the data they need from that store.

37
00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:01.710
But of course, getting the data is just one thing.

38
00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.840
Components also typically need

39
00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.510
to change that data over time,

40
00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:08.940
for example because a button was clicked

41
00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.180
or a forum was submitted.

42
00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.110
And NgRx also gives you a clearly defined,

43
00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:21.110
standardized way of performing such data changes.

44
00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:25.530
Because in the NgRx worlds, to change data in the Store,

45
00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.190
your Components must dispatch actions,

46
00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.430
which in the end describe the changes

47
00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:33.930
that should be performed

48
00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.930
and add any extra data that might be needed

49
00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.600
to change the data in the Store.

50
00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.680
And then those actions are picked up by so-called Reducers

51
00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.810
which you define as part

52
00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.620
of setting up this entire state management system.

53
00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.240
And in those Reducers,

54
00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:55.050
you then have the actual logic that gets triggered

55
00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:59.250
based on those actions to change the data in the Store.

56
00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:02.880
And of course, that's all pretty theoretical right now,

57
00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.700
we'll see all these things in action

58
00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.640
over the next lectures, of course.

59
00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.300
Last but not least, there's also one other building block

60
00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:15.750
in that NgRx world you should be aware of

61
00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.300
and that would be Effects.

62
00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:23.010
Effects are simply side effects, like for example,

63
00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.820
HTTP requests that should be sent to a backend,

64
00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:28.860
that should maybe also be triggered

65
00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:30.870
when certain Actions occur

66
00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:32.700
so that an Action, for example,

67
00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:37.700
does not just lead to data in that Store being changed,

68
00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:41.580
but maybe also in addition to an HTTP request

69
00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:43.770
being sent to a backend.

70
00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:45.300
So that's the big picture,

71
00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:48.690
and it's probably not 100% clear yet,

72
00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:52.080
but that's exactly why we're now going to explore

73
00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.960
these different building blocks step by step

74
00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:56.433
over the next lectures.
