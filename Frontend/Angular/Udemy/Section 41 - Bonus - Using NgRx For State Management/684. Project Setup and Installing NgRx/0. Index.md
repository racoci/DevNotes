1
00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.560
<v Maximilian>Now to get started with NgRx</v>

2
00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.560
we'll start with a very basic, simple dummy Angular app.

3
00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.270
We'll start with an app that has a counter

4
00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:15.150
that can be incremented and decremented.

5
00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.940
And of course, I really wanna say

6
00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.220
and emphasize this right away

7
00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.930
this is not an app where you would need NgRx.

8
00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.820
Instead using NgRx for an app like this would be overkill.

9
00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.670
You would be doing a lot of unnecessary setup work

10
00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:35.910
that would not really be worth the effort.

11
00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.390
But I'm deliberately using a very simple app like this,

12
00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.900
which is split up across two components

13
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.510
for outputting and controlling the counter

14
00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.510
and a service to slowly introduce NgRx

15
00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.250
and all its core concepts step by step

16
00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.100
so that you could then use NgRx

17
00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.110
in more complex apps thereafter.

18
00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:01.410
But for learning it, starting with a complex app

19
00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.380
would probably not be ideal.

20
00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:07.350
Therefore, attached to this lecture here

21
00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.350
you find this starting project here

22
00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.080
and you actually find it in two versions.

23
00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.190
One version that uses Ng modules

24
00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:19.770
and also a standalone version

25
00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.190
where we're using Standalone Components.

26
00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:26.670
Using NgRx, as you will see, will be quite similar

27
00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.250
no matter which approach you are using.

28
00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.560
And you will learn about both approaches

29
00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:32.730
in the next lectures

30
00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:35.340
and you can therefore then simply follow along

31
00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.380
with the approach you wanna use,

32
00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.470
or the approach you have to use in the project

33
00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.230
you might be working on in your job.

34
00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:46.560
So you'll find these two starting projects attached

35
00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.490
and it's exactly the same app using the same two Components

36
00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.490
and this one service just with or without Ng modules.

37
00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.270
So now that we get this starting project here

38
00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:05.130
and we get this big picture earlier in this section here

39
00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.420
it is now time to get started with NgRx.

40
00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.730
And for that in your Angular project

41
00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.060
no matter if it's using Standalone Components or not

42
00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.570
you can install NgRx by opening your terminal,

43
00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:19.980
your system terminal.

44
00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.160
And here I'm using the one integrated into my IDE,

45
00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.920
which in this case is Visual Studio Code.

46
00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.960
But you can of course also manually

47
00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:31.260
navigate into your project folder in your terminal

48
00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:32.433
or command prompt.

49
00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:35.730
And then once you are in your project

50
00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.920
in that terminal or command prompt,

51
00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.020
you can run ng add,

52
00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:42.360
which is using the Angular CLI

53
00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.210
for adding a library to your project.

54
00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:48.903
And then @ngrx/store.

55
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.860
And this must be written exactly like this @ngrx/store.

56
00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.530
And it's always the same command,

57
00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:01.923
no matter if you are using Standalone Components or not.

58
00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:07.760
And what this will do is it will download and install NgRx

59
00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.290
so this third party library,

60
00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.740
and it will also go through some very basic

61
00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:15.870
setup steps thereafter.

62
00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:18.540
So here I'll confirm with yes

63
00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.990
and this will now as mentioned, install those packages.

64
00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:23.250
And in my case here

65
00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:27.180
it also updated the app module TypeScript file.

66
00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:31.380
And in that file it essentially added this entry here.

67
00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:33.660
It also added this import,

68
00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:35.640
which I'll move to the top,

69
00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.560
to the other library imports.

70
00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.410
And then it added this line of code

71
00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:45.090
or this piece of code here in this imports array.

72
00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:47.790
And this simply will be the line of code

73
00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:51.720
that is responsible for setting up a store

74
00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.400
in this application.

75
00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.640
Because as I mentioned before, when using NgRx,

76
00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:59.460
you have always one global store

77
00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:02.190
which manages your application data.

78
00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:04.080
And that's the store that's getting set up

79
00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:05.850
with this line of code here,

80
00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:07.440
though of course at the moment

81
00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.450
it doesn't contain any data

82
00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:12.990
and it doesn't contain any logic for changing data.

83
00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:16.350
But that's what we will add over the next lectures.

84
00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:20.070
Now, if you're in a Standalone Components project

85
00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:23.160
it's exactly the same command you would run,

86
00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:26.010
ngrx/store is being added

87
00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:30.930
with ng add @ngrx/store.

88
00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:34.290
And again, it will download and install this package

89
00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:38.700
and then also update a file in my case here

90
00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:41.013
the main.ts file.

91
00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:44.790
And in that main.ts file

92
00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:48.630
it now added this piece of code here and this import,

93
00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:52.470
which again does create that global store.

94
00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:54.750
It's a slightly different piece of code

95
00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:57.930
than in the ng module based version.

96
00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:00.090
But in both cases

97
00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:03.930
this code here simply creates an empty store.

98
00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:06.570
And of course, we're now going to fill that store

99
00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:10.593
with some life and data over the next lectures.
