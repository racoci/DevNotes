<v Narrator>In this course section,</v>

2
00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:06.870
I'll introduce you to NgRx,

3
00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.040
a totally optional state management system,

4
00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.360
or to be precise, a state management library,

5
00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.890
a third-party package you can add to your Angular projects.

6
00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.370
And as already mentioned, NgRx is a library,

7
00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:26.160
a system that helps you with state management.

8
00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.950
Though in this course section, we'll take a closer look

9
00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:32.850
at what exactly NgRx is and how it works,

10
00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.580
and we'll dive into its core building blocks,

11
00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:37.020
its basic concepts,

12
00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.050
which you must know when working with NgRx.

13
00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.210
We'll learn how it stores state

14
00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.970
and how that state can be used in components.

15
00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:49.170
You will learn about reducers, actions, and selectors,

16
00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.070
and you will also learn how to work with NgRx effects

17
00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.953
and what that is and why you might want to use it.
