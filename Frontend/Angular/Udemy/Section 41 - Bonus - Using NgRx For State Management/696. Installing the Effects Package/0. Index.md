00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:05.430
<v Maximilian>Now, to handle side effects with NgRx,</v>

2
00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.820
you, first of all, should install an extra package

3
00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.520
provided by the NgRx team.

4
00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:14.220
And you can again do this by running ng add

5
00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:17.430
in your Angular project no matter how it's built.

6
00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.783
And then you want to add @ngrx/effects.

7
00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.567
So the command is ng add @ngrx/effects.

8
00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.520
This will then again install an extra package

9
00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:33.870
into the project.

10
00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.150
The effects package here.

11
00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:37.860
And it also manipulated

12
00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.670
my app.module.ts file here as it told me

13
00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.840
because there it now indeed added this EffectsModule

14
00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.053
which it added to the imports here.

15
00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:51.600
Similarly,

16
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.350
if you're in a standalone component Angular application,

17
00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.150
you also run ng add @ngrx/effects.

18
00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:03.750
And there it, of course, also installs this package then,

19
00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.140
but then there, in my case, it added this main.ts file

20
00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.220
because in that file, it now also added provideEffects

21
00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.020
to this providers array.

22
00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.053
And that's imported from ngrx/effects here.

23
00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.550
So that's how this effects package gets added.

24
00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:27.210
And this now gives us certain features that we can use

25
00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.120
to handle such side effects

26
00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:33.090
when certain actions are dispatched.

27
00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.630
And to show you a demo, let's say that in this application,

28
00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.400
we in the end want to make sure

29
00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.400
that whenever the counter gets changed,

30
00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.690
we save the updated counter in local storage,

31
00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:48.600
in the browser's local storage.

32
00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.360
We could also be sending an HTTP request.

33
00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.490
But here, I want to keep things simple

34
00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.660
and just save the counter value in local storage.

35
00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:01.473
That's what we'll implement here with NgRx Effects.
