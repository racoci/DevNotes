The following lectures apply to Angular \< v20. If you are working in a v20+ project, the changes described below will need to be implemented (as you go through the following lectures). Attached you also find updated code snapshots.

In Angular 20, the `prerender` entry in `angular.json` no longer exists, so you don't need to change anything there. Also, the `.txt` file for defining the routes to be prerendered is no longer used.

The `server.ts` file is now located in the `src` folder instead of the root folder, though this change doesn't directly affect your workflow.

What's new is the `app.routes.server.ts` file. For the SSR lessons, it's important to change `RenderMode.Prerender` to `RenderMode.Server` here:

```ts
import { RenderMode, ServerRoute } from '@angular/ssr';
 
export const serverRoutes: ServerRoute[] = [
 {
   path: '**',
   renderMode: RenderMode.Server
 }
];
For Static Site Generation (SSG), this file should look something like this, for example:
import { RenderMode, ServerRoute } from '@angular/ssr';
 
export const serverRoutes: ServerRoute[] = [
 {
   path: '',
   renderMode: RenderMode.Prerender
 },
 {
   path: 'users/:userId/tasks',
   renderMode: RenderMode.Prerender,
   async getPrerenderParams() {
     const ids = ['u1', 'u2', 'u3'];
     return ids.map(id => ({ userId: id }));
   }
 },
 {
   path: '**',
   renderMode: RenderMode.Server
 },
];

```
