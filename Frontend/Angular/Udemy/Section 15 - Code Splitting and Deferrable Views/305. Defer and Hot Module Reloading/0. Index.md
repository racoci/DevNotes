## Defer & Hot Module Reloading

In the next lectures, I show you `@defer` in action.

With the latest version of the Angular CLI, you'll not see the same behavior as I show since the CLI has "Hot Module Reloading" enabled (i.e., during development, it reloads parts of the website when code changes - not the entire site).

If you want to see the same behavior, you should run `ng serve --no-hmr`.

Of course the behavior of `@defer`, and how it works, is not impacted by that. It works as explained.
