00:00.540 --> 00:03.390
<v Maximilian>Now in order to work on that project</v>

1
00:03.390 --> 00:06.960
and work on the code, you also need some code editor.

2
00:06.960 --> 00:11.760
And of course here you can use any editor or IDE you want.

3
00:11.760 --> 00:13.770
If you don't have a clear preference,

4
00:13.770 --> 00:16.980
my recommendation would be Visual Studio Code

5
00:16.980 --> 00:20.400
because it's a free and highly extensible IDE

6
00:20.400 --> 00:23.610
that works on all operating systems.

7
00:23.610 --> 00:26.340
Once you did download and install it,

8
00:26.340 --> 00:29.760
you can use it to open that Angular project folder

9
00:29.760 --> 00:32.790
you created with the "ng new" command,

10
00:32.790 --> 00:35.490
and you should then see something like this.

11
00:35.490 --> 00:38.370
The exact number of files and folders

12
00:38.370 --> 00:41.190
you have here on the left can change over time

13
00:41.190 --> 00:45.060
and we'll explore in detail what all these files and folders

14
00:45.060 --> 00:48.090
are about at the beginning of the next section.

15
00:48.090 --> 00:51.120
But as you can see, this "ng new" command created

16
00:51.120 --> 00:54.660
quite a few sub folders and configuration files

17
00:54.660 --> 00:58.050
because we need those extra compilation steps

18
00:58.050 --> 01:00.210
I mentioned before and so on.

19
01:00.210 --> 01:02.490
Now, before we start diving into the code,

20
01:02.490 --> 01:06.900
or before we try running this code and testing it locally,

21
01:06.900 --> 01:08.910
there's one thing you should do here

22
01:08.910 --> 01:11.250
if you're using Visual Studio Code,

23
01:11.250 --> 01:15.213
you should go to the extensions area of this code editor,

24
01:16.830 --> 01:19.023
and then there, search for Angular.

25
01:20.040 --> 01:22.380
And you should at least install this

26
01:22.380 --> 01:26.160
Angular language service extension here

27
01:26.160 --> 01:30.570
because that will give you better IDE support for Angular.

28
01:30.570 --> 01:34.350
It will help with finding errors in your Angular code,

29
01:34.350 --> 01:36.930
it will give you code completions,

30
01:36.930 --> 01:38.610
but you also might wanna consider

31
01:38.610 --> 01:41.490
installing some other Angular extensions.

32
01:41.490 --> 01:45.150
For example, the Angular Essentials extension,

33
01:45.150 --> 01:47.160
which in the end bundles a couple of

34
01:47.160 --> 01:50.490
useful Angular extensions.

35
01:50.490 --> 01:52.380
And with those extensions added,

36
01:52.380 --> 01:55.410
you're then well prepared to write Angular code

37
01:55.410 --> 01:57.783
and you can go back to that explorer view.

38
01:58.650 --> 02:00.840
Now, as mentioned, we'll explore the files

39
02:00.840 --> 02:03.630
and folders we got here, and we'll start writing some

40
02:03.630 --> 02:06.780
useful code in the next course section.

41
02:06.780 --> 02:09.570
But one thing I wanna do right now already

42
02:09.570 --> 02:13.950
is run this project and preview it locally

43
02:13.950 --> 02:15.300
because that's something we'll do

44
02:15.300 --> 02:17.670
all the time whilst writing code

45
02:17.670 --> 02:19.980
because of course we wanna preview that code

46
02:19.980 --> 02:23.430
and preview our changes to test them locally

47
02:23.430 --> 02:26.253
before we deploy something to production.

48
02:27.390 --> 02:29.610
Therefore, you can and should open

49
02:29.610 --> 02:34.440
the integrated terminal here in Visual Studio Code

50
02:34.440 --> 02:36.603
by going to Terminal, New Terminal,

51
02:37.560 --> 02:41.760
which uses your default system terminal or command prompt,

52
02:41.760 --> 02:44.790
just integrated here into this code editor

53
02:44.790 --> 02:47.610
and automatically navigated into this folder,

54
02:47.610 --> 02:49.590
which is very useful

55
02:49.590 --> 02:52.620
because you need to be navigated into that folder

56
02:52.620 --> 02:56.460
to run this project and to preview it.

57
02:56.460 --> 03:00.240
And you can then start a local development server

58
03:00.240 --> 03:02.193
by running NPM start.

59
03:03.450 --> 03:06.780
This executes a script that's part of this project

60
03:06.780 --> 03:09.030
that spins up a development server,

61
03:09.030 --> 03:11.610
which allows you to preview the website

62
03:11.610 --> 03:15.780
by visiting this address here in your browser.

63
03:15.780 --> 03:19.380
And if you do visit that website, that address,

64
03:19.380 --> 03:22.230
you should see something like this on the screen.

65
03:22.230 --> 03:25.680
The exact content and look can change over time,

66
03:25.680 --> 03:28.980
that's just the automatically generated starting app

67
03:28.980 --> 03:31.110
and will work on different projects

68
03:31.110 --> 03:32.430
throughout the course anyways,

69
03:32.430 --> 03:35.130
so it doesn't matter too much what you see here,

70
03:35.130 --> 03:36.930
but you should see something

71
03:36.930 --> 03:40.980
and that proves that you were able to run that Angular app

72
03:40.980 --> 03:44.460
and that everything was created correctly.

73
03:44.460 --> 03:47.850
Now, whilst you are working on your code, you should keep

74
03:47.850 --> 03:50.340
that development server up and running.

75
03:50.340 --> 03:53.760
You can hide that terminal, but you shouldn't quit it.

76
03:53.760 --> 03:55.890
You shouldn't stop that process

77
03:55.890 --> 03:59.190
because as long as this process here is running,

78
03:59.190 --> 04:02.520
it will automatically watch for changes in your code.

79
04:02.520 --> 04:04.530
And whenever you save changes,

80
04:04.530 --> 04:07.110
it'll automatically reload this website

81
04:07.110 --> 04:08.850
and preview those changes

82
04:08.850 --> 04:11.223
which speeds up the development process.

83
04:12.210 --> 04:15.720
If you're done for the day, you can quit this server

84
04:15.720 --> 04:18.660
by either closing it by clicking this cross

85
04:18.660 --> 04:20.793
or by pressing CTRL C.

86
04:21.690 --> 04:25.800
You can then always restart it by rerunning "npm start".

87
04:25.800 --> 04:28.350
That's how you create an Angular project

88
04:28.350 --> 04:32.070
and how you prepare everything to work on that code,

89
04:32.070 --> 04:34.860
and that's the of exactly what we'll do in the next section.

90
04:34.860 --> 04:36.750
We'll dive into a new project,

91
04:36.750 --> 04:40.260
we'll start working on our first demo application,

92
04:40.260 --> 04:42.870
and most importantly, we'll get started

93
04:42.870 --> 04:46.173
with all those crucial Angular essentials you need to know.
