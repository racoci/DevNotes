00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:04.950
<v ->So now that you have an idea of what Angular is</v>

2
00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.380
and why you might wanna use it,

3
00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:11.190
before we start writing Angular code,

4
00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.190
there's one important thing you need to know

5
00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.660
and understand about Angular the framework.

6
00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.200
It is a framework that keeps on evolving

7
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.040
and innovating, though it does that in a very stable

8
00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:29.220
and backward-compatible way, which is also important

9
00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.850
because, of course, you don't wanna relearn Angular

10
00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.230
every year or so.

11
00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.530
But it's worth noting that Angular 2,

12
00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.300
the first version of Angular was released back in 2016,

13
00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:47.490
and it was Angular 2 and not Angular 1

14
00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:50.460
because Angular one is technically

15
00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.260
a totally different framework,

16
00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.400
which is now called AngularJS, which was created

17
00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:57.660
by the same team,

18
00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.330
or at least some team members were the same.

19
00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:02.970
But Angular 2 was a total rewrite,

20
00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:04.680
a totally different framework.

21
00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.190
But since then, there have been new versions

22
00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:11.250
of Angular coming out every year,

23
00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.480
or actually two new major versions every year

24
00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:20.310
because the Angular team adopted a release policy

25
00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.250
or strategy where they try

26
00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.750
to release a new major version every six months.

27
00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.890
But, and that's really important, this does not mean

28
00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.400
that Angular changes every six months

29
00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.400
and that what you learned is obsolete after six months.

30
00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.120
The opposite is the case.

31
00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:46.710
Angular has been a super stable framework,

32
00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.460
and if you were to learn Angular 2 today,

33
00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.850
most of the code you'd write would still work

34
00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.860
with the latest Angular version

35
00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.280
because whilst the Angular team has indeed

36
00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.260
changed some things over time

37
00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.020
and has added some new features,

38
00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.580
it always did that in a very backward-compatible way

39
00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:13.170
so that what you learned back then is still relevant today.

40
00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.470
Of course, with this course, I wanna teach Angular

41
00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.010
to everyone who wants to work with it.

42
00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.750
But the truth is that since we have all these versions,

43
00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.840
not all teams and companies use

44
00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.700
the latest version of Angular.

45
00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.770
Indeed, the opposite is the case.

46
00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:36.770
Quite a big chunk of teams and companies still use older

47
00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.070
or even very old Angular versions,

48
00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:43.530
so they don't necessarily have access

49
00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.710
to all the new features that have been added over time.

50
00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:49.200
And of course, with this course,

51
00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.860
I also wanna help you if you are working on a project

52
00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.370
that's using an older Angular version, which is why

53
00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.830
whenever I add content to the course,

54
00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:01.290
or I update parts of the course,

55
00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:05.520
I do it such that the old content also sticks around.

56
00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:10.110
And I try to make it clear whether some feature can be used

57
00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:12.030
in older versions as well,

58
00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:13.890
or if it's only available if you're

59
00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:17.040
using a certain minimum version of Angular.

60
00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.200
So I really try my best to make sure

61
00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.060
that you get the most out of this course,

62
00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:25.410
no matter with which Angular version you are working.

63
00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:26.670
There, for example,

64
00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:31.020
have been two very important Angular releases:

65
00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:33.900
the versions 14 and 16,

66
00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.530
which introduced a concept called standalone components,

67
00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.360
and a concept called signals.

68
00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.910
And you'll learn all about that throughout the course,

69
00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:44.130
I won't explain it here of course.

70
00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:46.500
But it's features like this, which were added

71
00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:51.000
as optional features, so which were not a must use,

72
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.370
but instead, added such that you could also

73
00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:56.040
keep on writing code as you always did.

74
00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.110
But it's features like this, which for example,

75
00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:01.230
are not available if you're stuck on an older version.

76
00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:03.300
And I'll highlight that in the course

77
00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:07.140
because I wanna make sure that you really learn Angular

78
00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:09.300
such that you can use it no matter

79
00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:11.160
on which project you're working.

80
00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.320
Whilst, of course, also making sure

81
00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:15.900
that you are learning Angular in a modern

82
00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:17.700
and future-proof way.

83
00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:19.620
It's difficult, but it's my job.

84
00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:22.560
I wanna make sure that you get a great course experience.

85
00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.650
And therefore, now that you know how Angular evolved

86
00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:28.350
and that it does that in a very backward-compatible

87
00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:31.350
and stable way, and that there are new versions

88
00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:33.750
every six months, which don't mean that you need

89
00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:35.250
to relearn everything

90
00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:37.920
and that with this course, I try to keep up.

91
00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:40.620
Now that you know all that, let's dive in,

92
00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:43.893
and let's get started learning and using Angular.
