00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.970
<v ->Welcome to this Angular Course,</v>

2
00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:05.400
It's great to have you on board.

3
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.890
My name is Maximilian Schwarzmüller,

4
00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.710
I am a professional Angular developer

5
00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.390
and online course instructor.

6
00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:14.130
And with this course,

7
00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.760
I've taught hundreds of thousands of students

8
00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.080
how to use Angular

9
00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.570
and how to use it in their day-to-day jobs.

10
00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.900
And, of course, my goal is to also teach you

11
00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.600
how to work with Angular, what it's all about,

12
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.790
and to dive into all the basic

13
00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:32.130
and advanced features you need to know

14
00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.740
in order to become an Angular developer

15
00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:37.740
or to become better as an Angular developer,

16
00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:39.960
whatever your starting point is.

17
00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.240
Speaking of that, for this course,

18
00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:45.810
you need no prior Angular experience,

19
00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:50.520
basic web development and JavaScript experience suffices

20
00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.920
because we'll start at the very basics,

21
00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.360
and we'll then gradually

22
00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.240
dive deeper and deeper into Angular,

23
00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:58.680
into the essential features,

24
00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.330
the more advanced features,

25
00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:02.280
so that by the end of the course,

26
00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.000
you'll be able to use Angular in your next project

27
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.500
and you'll be able to call yourself an Angular developer,

28
00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.020
and therefore, let's not waste any time,

29
00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.250
let's dive right in,

30
00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.820
and let's start with the most important question,

31
00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.400
what exactly is Angular?

32
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.780
Before we do that, of course,

33
00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.450
also start creating Angular projects

34
00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.640
and before we then start writing code,

35
00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.393
but what is this Angular thing and why would you use it?
