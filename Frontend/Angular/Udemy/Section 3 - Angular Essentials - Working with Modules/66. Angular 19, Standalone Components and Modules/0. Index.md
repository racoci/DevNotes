Angular 19, Standalone Components & Modules

With the release of **Angular 19, standalone components became the default** for new Angular components.

That means that if you DON'T set `standalone: false` (e.g., if you don't set `standalone` at all) inside of `@Component()`, you'll get a standalone component (which won't work in the Modules-based approach covered by this section)!

In older Angular versions (< 19), it was exactly the other way around: Module-based components were the default - i.e., you had to explicitly set `standalone: true` to get a standalone component. Not setting `standalone` at all would give you a Module-based component.

Therefore, you should check your `package.json` file to see whether you're using Angular 19+ or not.

If you are, make sure to always add `standalone: false` in this course section here to use Module-based components.

For the majority of the course this won't matter since we use standalone components as a default anyways. But for this section here, it does matter since it's explicitly NOT about standalone components.
