00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:01.740
<v Maximilian>Now it should make sense</v>

2
00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.280
that Angular doesn't know the app-tasks component,

3
00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:07.770
as well as some other components anymore.

4
00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:09.840
And now that we're trying to start

5
00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.050
the Angular application with this module.

6
00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:17.400
Because we faced a similar error way earlier in this course

7
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.040
when we got started with Components.

8
00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:22.270
I mentioned earlier in the course

9
00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:24.600
that Angular would not go ahead

10
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.183
and scan your entire project and register everything

11
00:00:28.183 --> 00:00:31.800
that looks like a component as a Component.

12
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.100
Instead, you explicitly need to tell Angular

13
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.950
which components make up your application

14
00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.280
and how they should be aware of each other.

15
00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.740
And with Standalone Components,

16
00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:47.700
we of course do that with help of this imports array,

17
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.690
but we no longer have that on Module-based Components.

18
00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.030
Instead there it's in that module

19
00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.490
where we have to declare all the Components

20
00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:58.563
that should know about each other.

21
00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.860
And therefore here in our application,

22
00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:06.180
we should not just add the AppComponent to our app module,

23
00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.830
but also all the components

24
00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.963
that are being used by that Component.

25
00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.270
Which means we, for example,

26
00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.680
also should add the HeaderComponent here

27
00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.680
because the AppComponent in its template uses this header.

28
00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:27.450
But we should also add the user and tasks Components.

29
00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.340
So therefore, back in the app module,

30
00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.620
we should also add this UserComponent

31
00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.863
and the TasksComponent.

32
00:01:38.967 --> 00:01:39.800
Now of course,

33
00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.417
I'm getting a bunch of errors here now though,

34
00:01:41.417 --> 00:01:44.880
because these are all Standalone Components

35
00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.233
and I mentioned that you can't add those to declarations.

36
00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.667
Now what you can do if you wanna keep those components

37
00:01:53.667 --> 00:01:57.960
as Standalone Components because you are, for example,

38
00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.590
slowly but steadily migrating your project over,

39
00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.780
what you can do in such a scenario

40
00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.320
is you can add a imports array to your module

41
00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.780
just as we had those imports arrays

42
00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.030
on our Standalone Components.

43
00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.820
And add any Standalone Components,

44
00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:17.520
you wanna register for your application

45
00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.793
to that imports array instead of the declarations array.

46
00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.670
So, the declarations array is for non-Standalone Components.

47
00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.753
The imports array can be used for Standalone Components.

48
00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:35.163
And with that, we got no errors here anymore.

49
00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:37.920
However, you will see

50
00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.005
that as you try to view your application,

51
00:02:40.005 --> 00:02:42.810
you won't see anything on the screen.

52
00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.790
And if you open the Browser Developer Tools,

53
00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.780
you'll see an error here that a required Injectable

54
00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.260
was not found in the dependency injection tree.

55
00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.570
And we actually get an additional hint,

56
00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:57.180
actually a solution for the problem

57
00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.660
that if we are bootstrapping an NgModule, which we are,

58
00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.565
we're trying to bootstrap the application

59
00:03:02.565 --> 00:03:04.560
with the AppModule,

60
00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.983
we should make sure that the BrowserModule is imported.

61
00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:13.020
Because modules can actually also import other modules

62
00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:17.100
and will build another custom other module later.

63
00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.440
But one module that has been built for us

64
00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.500
by the Angular team, which we should import here,

65
00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.400
is the BrowserModule,

66
00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.153
which is imported from @angular/platform-browser.

67
00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:34.620
This is a module provided by the Angular team

68
00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:38.760
that in the end provides a collection of things

69
00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.250
that are needed by every Angular app

70
00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.140
in order to run correctly.

71
00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:47.350
This includes some generally helpful directives

72
00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:49.470
that might be used in your application,

73
00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:51.660
but also some other crucial features

74
00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:53.883
every application needs access to.

75
00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.915
That's why you must import this here.

76
00:03:56.915 --> 00:04:00.450
And then, also add it to the imports array

77
00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:05.450
of your RootModule, so of your Appmodule typically.

78
00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:10.352
Every Angular application when using Angular modules

79
00:04:10.352 --> 00:04:12.693
needs that BrowserModule.

80
00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:17.370
Well, and with that, if you saved it and you reload,

81
00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:19.650
you see we got no more errors here.

82
00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:23.433
And the application indeed, again, works as before.

83
00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:26.430
And that's therefore also an example

84
00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:28.740
that shows us how we can combine

85
00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:32.460
Standalone and Module-based Components

86
00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:36.420
by adding any Standalone Components to imports

87
00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:40.590
and any non-Standalone Components to declarations.

88
00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:42.114
But we're of course still not done

89
00:04:42.114 --> 00:04:44.103
with this application here.
