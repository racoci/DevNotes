# First Time in This Course

Welcome to the Network Defense course. To get the most out of this course, we recommend that you complete the Endpoint Security course as a prerequisite. NetDef provides both foundational and intermediate knowledge and skills that you will use every day in your role as a Cybersecurity Technician. You will learn about different ways to monitor your network and how to evaluate alerts that you receive. You will delve into the tools and techniques used to protect your network, including access control, firewalls, cloud security, and cryptography. These monitoring and defense tools, along with others, work together to create a layered defense-in-depth cybersecurity strategy. The knowledge and skills that you learn will help you defend networks against many types of attacks and quickly react to any exploits that may occur. These course materials will give you the knowledge and skills you need to do the following:

- Explain approaches to network security defense.
- Explain the various aspects of system and network defense.
- Configure local and server-based access control.
- Implement access control lists (ACLs) to filter traffic and mitigate network attacks.
- Explain how firewalls are implemented to provide network security.
- Implement Zone-Based Policy Firewall using CLI.
- Recommend cloud security requirements based on a given cloud scenario.
- Determine the cryptographic techniques that are required to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity.
- Explain how security technologies affect security monitoring.
- Use different types of logs and records to store information regarding hosts and the network.
- Explain the process of evaluating alerts.
