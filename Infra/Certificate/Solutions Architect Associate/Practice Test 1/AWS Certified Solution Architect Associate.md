# Question 1
A software company has a globally distributed team of developers, that requires secure and compliant access to AWS environments. The company manages multiple AWS accounts under AWS Organizations and uses an on-premises Microsoft Active Directory for user authentication. To simplify access control and identity governance across projects and accounts, the company wants a centrally managed solution that integrates with their existing infrastructure. The solution should require the least amount of ongoing operational management.

Which approach best meets the companyâ€™s requirements?

- Deploy AWS Directory Service for Microsoft Active Directory in AWS. Establish a trust relationship with the on-premises Active Directory. Use IAM roles linked to AD groups to control access to AWS resources

- Use AWS Directory Service AD Connector to connect AWS to the on-premises Active Directory. Integrate AD Connector with AWS IAM Identity Center. Use permission sets to assign access to AWS accounts and resources based on Active Directory group membership

- Deploy an open-source identity provider (IdP) on Amazon EC2. Synchronize it with the on-premises Active Directory and use SAML to federate access to AWS accounts. Assign IAM roles to federated users based on SAML assertions

- Use AWS Control Tower to enable account access for developers. Create AWS IAM roles in each member account and manually assign permissions. Instruct developers to assume roles across accounts using the AWS CLI

# Question 2
A major bank is using Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) to migrate several core banking applications to the cloud to ensure high availability and cost efficiency while simplifying administrative complexity and overhead. The development team at the bank expects a peak rate of about 1000 messages per second to be processed via SQS. It is important that the messages are processed in order.

Which of the following options can be used to implement this system?

Use Amazon SQS FIFO (First-In-First-Out) queue in batch mode of 2 messages per operation to process the messages at the peak rate
Use Amazon SQS FIFO (First-In-First-Out) queue in batch mode of 4 messages per operation to process the messages at the peak rate
Use Amazon SQS FIFO (First-In-First-Out) queue to process the messages
Use Amazon SQS standard queue to process the messages
