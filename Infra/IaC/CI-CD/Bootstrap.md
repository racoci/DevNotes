## Prompt

I'm trying to create a CI-CD pipeline to use for a project of Infrastructure as Code (IaC).

Initial definitions:
- I have to use Jenkins to deploy infrastructure using terraform.
- I have to use terraform for everything related to IaC
- I have to use aws.
- I have aws-cli/2.16.2 Python/3.11.8 Linux/5.15.0-139-generic exe/x86_64.ubuntu.20
- I don't have access to the aws web console.
- I'm using ubuntu 20.04
- I use python version 3.8.10
- I use Docker version 28.1.1, build 4eba377
- I want the jenkins to run inside a docker on aws so I can test it locally first
- I'm working on a shared bitbucket git repository so I need to track changes
