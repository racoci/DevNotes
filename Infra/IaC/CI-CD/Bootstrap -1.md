## Prompt

I'm trying to create a CI-CD pipeline to use for a project of Infrastructure as Code (IaC). In particular, my first task is to build a jenkins capable of deploying itself.

Initial definitions:
- I have to use Jenkins to deploy infrastructure using terraform.
- I have to use terraform for everything related to IaC
- I have to use aws.
- I have aws-cli/2.16.2 Python/3.11.8 Linux/5.15.0-139-generic exe/x86_64.ubuntu.20
- I don't have access to the aws web console.
- I'm using ubuntu 20.04
- I use python version 3.8.10
- I use Docker version 28.1.1, build 4eba377
- I want the jenkins to run inside a docker on aws so I can test it locally first
- I'm working on a shared bitbucket git repository so I need to track changes for deploy only inside a particular directory and only in some particular branches, but I want this to be configurable
- I want the jenkins docker infrastructure to be managed by job inside the same jenkins so I'll need one of the jobs to be a self-deploy
- I want a full plan and estimation of costs for the whole architecture before any code.
- Use plantuml to do any diagrams
- I need the jenkins to be accessible using a public URL, but I don't have permission to buy any dommain  so we'll have to use some AWS service that provides a public URL by default and I need this URL as one of the outputs of the terraform code
- Every resource created, deployed or updated by this jenkins must include a tag `GE-IaC-STS-CI-CD-Jenkins-2025` and key-value pairs showing the initial created date and last-updated date in the format `2025-09-13 14-03-57.123 UTC` 

Help me build a plan to accomplish all of this and ask me any necessary clarifications. Don't assume anything. I want you to clarify anything I didn't already say before any estimation or plan.

We can do this in steps, so initially, the minimum is to build a Jenkins docker that can be run locally on my configurations and can deploy itself.

The jenkins will also need to have some AWS credentials. I think it's not safe to use my own credentials to do this, but I don't have access to the web console so you'll need to show me just aws cli commands to create those credentials for Jenkins.

## Clarification Questions



# CI-CD Pipeline for Infrastructure as Code with Jenkins

Thank you for providing detailed requirements. Before I create a comprehensive plan and cost estimation, I need some clarifications to ensure I understand your needs correctly:

## Clarifications Questions

1. **AWS Region**: Which AWS region do you plan to use for deployment?

2. **Jenkins Configuration**: 
   - What specific Jenkins plugins will you need beyond the basic installation?
   - Do you need any specific security configurations for Jenkins (SSL, authentication methods)?

3. **Terraform Version**: What version of Terraform should we use?

4. **Resource Specifications**:
   - What EC2 instance type or size do you prefer for running Jenkins?
   - Any specific storage requirements for Jenkins?

5. **Network Configuration**:
   - Should Jenkins be deployed in a new VPC or an existing one?
   - Any specific subnet requirements?

6. **Security Requirements**:
   - Should Jenkins be deployed in a private subnet with a load balancer, or directly in a public subnet?
   - Any specific security group requirements beyond default?

7. **High Availability & Backup**:
   - Is high availability required for Jenkins?
   - Do you need a backup strategy for Jenkins configuration and jobs?

8. **Monitoring**:
   - Should we set up CloudWatch monitoring for Jenkins and the deployed infrastructure?

9. **Budget Constraints**:
   - Are there any budget constraints I should consider when designing the architecture?

10. **Bitbucket Integration**:
    - Do you already have Bitbucket credentials or OAuth apps configured for Jenkins integration?
    - Should the pipeline trigger on all branches or specific ones (like main, develop, etc.)?

11. **Docker Registry**:
    - Where will the Jenkins Docker image be stored? ECR, Docker Hub, or elsewhere?

## Clarifications Answers

1. **AWS Region**: Which AWS region do you plan to use for deployment?

We'll use us-east-1, but it should be easy to change this for all resources if necessary

2. **Jenkins Configuration**: 
   - What specific Jenkins plugins will you need beyond the basic installation?
	   - I don't know the existing plugins. But we'll need to interface with bitbucket and use terraform to do deploys. We already know there'll be an angular front-end, but I'm not sure if that requires a particular plugin to make the deploy.
   - Do you need any specific security configurations for Jenkins (SSL, authentication methods)?
	   - I don't know. I need the URL to be https so maybe. Help me here, I'm a newbie

2. **Terraform Version**: What version of Terraform should we use?
	1. Terraform v1.12.1 on linux_amd64


4. **Resource Specifications**:
   - What EC2 instance type or size do you prefer for running Jenkins?
	   - The cheapest that can fulfill the required conditions
   - Any specific storage requirements for Jenkins?
	   - I don't know. Help me here. Why would we need storage?

5. **Network Configuration**:
   - Should Jenkins be deployed in a new VPC or an existing one?
	   - Assume there's no current infra. We are starting from scratch
   - Any specific subnet requirements?
	   - I don't know. What are some common requirements? Why would we need anything in particular?

6. **Security Requirements**:
   - Should Jenkins be deployed in a private subnet with a load balancer, or directly in a public subnet?
	   - The cheapest option that is able to fulfill the requirements
   - Any specific security group requirements beyond default?
	   - I don't know. Give suggestions. What kind of requirements do you thing might be necesary?

7. **High Availability & Backup**:
   - Is high availability required for Jenkins?
	   - No it'll be run very sporadically. This is a toy project.
   - Do you need a backup strategy for Jenkins configuration and jobs?
	   - I guess. But I don't really know. Why is this usually required?

8. **Monitoring**:
   - Should we set up CloudWatch monitoring for Jenkins and the deployed infrastructure?

9. **Budget Constraints**:
   - Are there any budget constraints I should consider when designing the architecture?
	   - Yes, try to spend the minimum possible. This is not a real project. It's for studying purposes so I have no budget. Try to keep everything you can inside free-tier.

10. **Bitbucket Integration**:
    - Do you already have Bitbucket credentials or OAuth apps configured for Jenkins integration?
	    - Maybe but I don't know how to check this. Anyway we can let this for a next phase. We first need an working instance of Jenkins deployed, so any bitbucket configuration we can leave to a next step.
    - Should the pipeline trigger on all branches or specific ones (like main, develop, etc.)?
	    - Just specific ones. This should be configurable. But let's first build a pipeline that's only manually trigerable

11. **Docker Registry**:
    - Where will the Jenkins Docker image be stored? ECR, Docker Hub, or elsewhere?
	    - I have to use only AWS services so probably ECR
